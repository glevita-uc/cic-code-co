     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, due to the many mobilizations subsequent to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many families of Colorado National Guard members and reservists face financial hardships when the National Guard member or reservist is called to active military duty or state active duty because the military pay of a soldier is often far less than his or her civilian salary. Because private companies often do not make up the difference in salary, military families may see a significant drop in household income while a family member is away on active military duty or state active duty. In addition, active duty military personnel and their families encounter additional hardships when the active duty member is deployed to zones in which he or she will encounter hostile fire. Many families of Colorado National Guard members, reservists, and active duty military personnel also face additional expenses caused by a long family separation. The general assembly further finds and declares that grants from the military family relief fund are intended to help families defray the costs of food, housing, utilities, medical services, and other expenses that may be difficult to afford when a family member leaves civilian employment for active military duty, is on active military duty in a hostile fire zone, or is called to state active duty by executive order of the governor.

     Militia may arrest and imprison participants.
    </b>
    Where the governor has declared an insurrection to exist, the militia has authority to arrest and imprison any person participating in or aiding and abetting such insurrection and to detain such person in custody until the insurrection is suppressed. In re Moyer, 35<cite class="co_code">Colo. 159</cite>, 85 P. 190 (1905).

       <b>
        If arrests are made in good faith, governor is not liable.
       </b>
       So long as arrests of those whom the governor considers to stand in the way of restoring peace are made in good faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order to head the insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an action after he is out of office on the ground that he has not reasonable ground for his belief. Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78, 29 S. Ct. 235, 53 L. Ed. 410 (1909).

      Compensation payable to guardians shall be based upon services rendered and shall not exceed five percent of the amount of income received during the period covered by the account; except that such percentage compensation shall not be allowed on the moneys or other assets received from a prior guardian nor upon the amount received from liquidation of loans or other investments. In the event five percent of income received during the period would be less than twenty-five dollars and the personal property in the estate totals not more than one thousand five hundred dollars, twenty-five dollars may be taken as the guardian's compensation. If the personal property in the estate exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars and five percent of the income would be less than fifty dollars, the guardian's compensation may be fifty dollars. In any case in which the compensation under the foregoing appropriate rates is inadequate because of extra services performed, the court, upon petition and hearing thereon, may authorize reasonable additional compensation. A copy of the petition and notice of hearing thereon shall be given the proper office of the veterans administration in the manner provided in the case of hearing on a guardian's account or other pleading.

       The court may authorize the purchase of the entire fee simple title to real estate in this state in which the guardian has no interest, but only as a home for the ward, or to protect his or her interest, or as a home for his or her dependent family. Such purchase of real estate shall not be made except upon the entry of an order of the court after hearing upon verified petition. A copy of the petition shall be furnished the proper office of the veterans administration, and notice of hearing thereon shall be given said office as provided in the case of hearing on a guardian's account.

       Before authorizing such investment, the court shall require written evidence of value and of title and of the advisability of acquiring such real estate. Title shall be taken in the ward's name. This section does not limit the right of the guardian on behalf of his or her ward to bid and to become the purchaser of real estate at a sale thereof pursuant to decree of foreclosure of lien held by or for the ward, or at a trustee's sale, to protect the ward's right in the property so foreclosed or sold; nor does it limit the right of the guardian, if such is necessary to protect the ward's interest and upon prior order of the court in which the guardianship is pending, to agree with cotenants of the ward for a partition in kind, or to purchase from cotenants the entire undivided interests held by them, or to bid and purchase the same at a sale under a partition decree, or to compromise adverse claims of title to the ward's realty.

       When, in any proceeding under the laws of this state for the commitment or certification of a person alleged to have a mental health disorder or otherwise be in need of confinement in a hospital or other institution for his or her proper care, it is determined after such adjudication of the status of such person as may be required by law that commitment or certification to a hospital for treatment of mental health disorders or other institution is necessary for safekeeping or treatment and it appears that the person is eligible for care or treatment by the veterans administration, the court, upon receipt of a certificate from the veterans administration showing that facilities are available and that the person is eligible for care or treatment therein, may commit or certify the person to the veterans administration. Upon commitment or certification, the person, when admitted to any facility operated by such agency within or without this state, is subject to the rules and regulations of the veterans administration. The chief officer of any facility of the veterans administration to which the person is committed or certified, with respect to the person committed or certified, is vested with the same powers as superintendents of state hospitals for mental health disorders within this state with respect to retention of custody, transfer, parole, or discharge as restored to reason.

Consent is given to the application of the law of the committing state or district in respect to the authority of the chief officer of any facility of the veterans administration to retain custody or transfer, parole, or discharge the committed person.

Any person transferred as provided in this section is deemed to be committed or certified to the veterans administration for all purposes as provided in subsection (1) of this section as on original commitment or certification.
