    Declaration of Independence
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   In Congress, July 4, 1776.
  </p>
  <p>
   THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THIRTEEN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
  </p>
  <p>
   We hold these truths to be self-evident: - that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world:
  </p>
  <p>
   He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation, till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
   He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature - a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into a compliance with his measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise, the state remaining, in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasions from without, and convulsions within.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of land.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws establishing judiciary powers.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers, to harass our people and eat out their substance.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation.
  </p>
  <p>
   For quartering large bodies of armed troops amongst us;
  </p>
  <p>
   For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;
  </p>
  <p>
   For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;
  </p>
  <p>
   For imposing taxes on us without our consent;
  </p>
  <p>
   For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;
  </p>
  <p>
   For transporting us beyond the seas to be tried for pretended offenses;
  </p>
  <p>
   For abolishing the free system of English laws, in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;
  </p>
  <p>
   For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the forms of our government;
  </p>
  <p>
   For suspending our own legislature, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever;
  </p>
  <p>
   He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people.
  </p>
  <p>
   He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and bretheren, or to fall themselves by their hands.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has excited domestic insurrection amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind - enemies in war; in peace, friends.
  </p>
  <p>
   We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in general congress assembled, appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

    Editor's note:
    <br/>
   </b>
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li id="constitution-us2ol11">
    This version of the Constitution of the United States of America is a continuation of a format for printing the Constitution that was initiated in 1908 by a commissioner appointed by the supreme court of the state of Colorado. This version contains a table of contents, changes in spelling and capitalization, caption headings, editor's notes, and an index. Additionally, the brackets in article I, section 2, clause (3) on page 11 indicate that the language contained therein was superseded or modified by amendments (see section 2 of the fourteenth amendment on page 21 and the sixteenth amendment on page 21); the brackets in article I, section 3, clauses (1) and (2) on page 11 indicate that the language contained therein is superseded or modified by the seventeenth amendment on page 22; and the brackets in article II, section 1, clause (3) on page 14 indicate that the language contained therein is superseded by the twelfth amendment on page 20. The reader should also note that provisions in article I, section 4, clause (2) on page 12 are superseded or modified by the twentieth amendment on page 22.
   </li>
   <li id="constitution-us2ol12">
    The twenty-seven articles of amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, including the Bill of Rights, are numbered and titled in this publication as "articles", rather than individual "amendments" to the Constitution. This practice is based on the language used in the original proposals to amend the Constitution by the addition of articles of amendment, as well as on the official revised version of the Constitution of the United States which the 108th Congress of the United States ordered printed in 2003. That version of the Constitution provides that the "articles [are] in addition to, and amendment of, the constitution of the United States of America, proposed by Congress, and ratified by the legislatures of the several states, pursuant to the fifth article of the original Constitution." [See United States House of Representatives Document 108-95.]
   The practice of calling the articles of amendment "articles" is also consistent with, and even predates, the version of the Constitution commissioned by the Colorado Supreme Court in 1908, and dates as far back as the 1861 publication of the state's laws. However, recent trends in the publication of the articles of amendment to the Constitution may use the common term "amendments" rather than "articles".

The person having the greatest number of votes for president shall be the president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers, not exceeding three, on the list of those voted for as president, the house of representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the president.

And if the house of representatives shall not choose a president whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the vice-president shall act as president, as in the case of death or other constitutional disability of the president.
