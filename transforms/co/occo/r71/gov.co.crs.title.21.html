     Appointment within ambit of constitutional provision.
    </b>
    The Colorado constitution allows the supreme court to appoint "such . . . personnel as the court may deem necessary to aid in the administration of the courts". Certainly, the general assembly's determination that the state public defender be appointed by the Colorado supreme court is within the ambit of this constitutional provision. People v. Mullins, 188<cite class="co_code">Colo. 29</cite>, 532 P.2d 736 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     And is not violative of due process or separation of powers.
    </b>
    The office of the state public defender is not unconstitutional and does not violate the separation of powers doctrine or deny defendants a trial in accord with the due process clause of the state and federal constitutions. Although the state public defender is appointed and his compensation is fixed by the Colorado supreme court, this statutory scheme does not create such a nexus as would violate the due process provisions, the separation of powers doctrine, or the right a defendant has to a fair trial. People v. Mullins, 188<cite class="co_code">Colo. 29</cite>, 532 P.2d 736 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Nor do statutory protections violate separation of powers.
    </b>
    The statutory system in Colorado, which protects the public defender's office with certain statutory safeguards, in no way violates the principles of separation of powers or the other guarantees of due process. People v. Mullins, 188<cite class="co_code">Colo. 29</cite>, 532 P.2d 736 (1975).

    Since employment in a public defender's office is not the type of public employment contemplated in Ethical Consideration 9-3 and Disciplinary Rule 9-101(B) of the code of professional responsibility, no conflict of interest can be perceived in the representation of a defendant by a deputy public defender and the subsequent representation by the same attorney in a private capacity of the defendant in the same case.

       On and after January 1, 1997, the alternate defense counsel shall contract, where feasible, without prior approval of the court, for the provision of attorney services for cases described in section  21-2-103 (1). To provide for adequate legal representation of indigent persons, the office of alternate defense counsel may contract, where feasible, without prior approval of the court, for the provision of investigative services for cases described in section  21-1-103 (1). The office of alternate defense counsel shall establish, where feasible, a list of approved contract attorneys to serve as counsel and a list of approved investigators to provide investigative services in such cases. As a condition of placement on the approved list, the contracting attorney or investigator shall agree to provide services based on the terms to be established in a contract, at either a fixed fee or the hourly rate for reimbursement set by the supreme court. Terms of the contract shall be negotiated between the alternate defense counsel and the contract attorney or investigator. Contracts made with an attorney shall specify that the services shall be provided subject to the Colorado rules of professional conduct.

     The phrase "where feasible"
    </b>
    indicates that the existence of the "list" is not a prerequisite to the provision of alternate defense counsel representation. Therefore, appointment of alternate defense counsel by court is valid even if the individual attorney is not "on the official list" established by the office of alternate defense counsel. People v. Hodges, 134 P.3d 419 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd on other grounds, 158 P.3d 922 (Colo. 2007).

     Mandatory language in the alternate defense counsel statute limits
    </b>
    the district court's authority to appoint counsel for indigent defendants to those attorneys on the "official list" established by the office of alternate defense counsel. The alternate defense counsel statute does not create a statutory right in defendants with regard to its procedural aspects; therefore, representation by counsel not on the "official list" did not violate any cognizable right of the defendant under this statute. Hodge v. People, 158 P.3d 922 (Colo. 2007).
