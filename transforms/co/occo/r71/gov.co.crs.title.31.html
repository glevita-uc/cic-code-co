    Editor's note:
   </b>
   This title was primarily numbered as articles within chapter 139, C.R.S. 1963; however, a few sections were located in article 1 of chapter 140, C.R.S. 1963. The provisions of this title were repealed and reenacted in 1975, resulting in the addition, relocation, and elimination of sections as well as subject matter. For amendments to this title prior to 1975, consult the Colorado statutory research explanatory note and the table itemizing the replacement volumes and supplements to the original volume of C.R.S. 1973 beginning on page vii in the front of this volume. Former C.R.S. section numbers are shown in editor's notes following those sections that were relocated. For a detailed comparison of this title, see the comparative tables located in the back of the index.

       In the recodification of this title, certain provisions which previously applied or may have been interpreted to apply to limited categories of municipalities have been applied to all municipalities, whether statutory, home rule, or special territorial charter. Except for those provisions which expressly apply only to limited categories of municipalities, it is the intent of the general assembly that the provisions of this title shall apply to home rule municipalities except insofar as superseded by charter or ordinance passed pursuant to such charter and to all statutory cities and towns and shall be available to special territorial charter cities and towns unless in conflict with the charters thereof. The general assembly further declares that in the recodification of this title and in the use of the term "municipality" in this title there is no legislative intent to affect or modify the application of the provisions of this title with respect to preemption of home rule or special territorial charter powers, which preemption may or may not have existed on the effective date of this recodification (July 1, 1975).

       In conformity with the provisions of section  31-1-101 (10), the regular election date for towns reorganizing into cities shall remain, after reorganization, the first Tuesday of April in each even-numbered year unless a majority of the registered electors of the city voting on the question have voted to hold the regular election of the city on a different date pursuant to section  31-10-109 (1), in which case the regular election date of the city shall mean, for such city, the date on which the regular election of officers takes place as determined by the registered electors of the city. Notwithstanding the provisions of section  31-10-109 (1), after reorganization, the governing body of the city may by ordinance establish its regular election date on the Tuesday succeeding the first Monday of November in each odd-numbered year, and may include in such ordinance any alteration in the term of office of officials subsequently elected which may be necessary to accomplish the change in election dates in an orderly manner. In no event shall such ordinance shorten the term of any elected official in office at the time of its adoption.

       There is no reason why those who object to the incorporation of a town should not enter appearance in the proceeding in the district court and there present their protests. A hearing thereon in regular manner would make for orderly proceedings on direct issues and forestall round-about attacks in an effort to accomplish indirectly that which could much better be pursued by direct method and having entered appearance and protest, in event of adverse judgment, review by writ of error would be in order. Neither is this the only avenue available where it is contended that the county court was without or exceeded its jurisdiction, or abused its discretion, since C.R.C.P. 106(a)(4) provides a "plain, speedy, and adequate remedy".

In other words, the general assembly used the term "fee", not according to its technical legal meaning, but as vesting in the city a complete, perpetual, and continuous title to the space designated as streets, so long as it used them for the purpose intended.

       When any town has failed, for a period of five years or longer immediately prior to the filing of the application under this section, to hold any regular or special election or to elect officers and to maintain any town government, such town may be determined to be abandoned as follows:
       <ol Class="alpha">

         The county attorney of the county in which the town is located or any owner of land in such town may make application to the secretary of state to determine that the town is abandoned.

        </li>
        <li id="t31-corporateclass-organizationandterritory-ar03-p02-s31-3-201ol11c">
         The secretary of state shall hear such application and, after receiving evidence thereon, shall determine whether or not said town has been abandoned. If he determines that the town is abandoned, a copy of such determination shall be filed with the county clerk and recorder of the county in which said town was located. Thereupon, said town shall cease to exist.

        Special meeting presumed legal and regularly called.

       Under this section when the record of a special meeting kept by the clerk shows that the meeting was called for the purpose of transacting the very business which was transacted, and that every member of the council was present and participated in the proceedings, the presumption is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the meeting was a legal meeting duly and regularly called.

       It is not required, under this section, that notice to the members or the record of service shall be preserved in any particular manner. Hence, when the record shows that a special meeting was called and held, it is to be presumed that the call was regular and that the service of notice was duly made as required by the statute, at least, until the contrary is proved.

If such an ordinance is adopted, it shall also provide that any ordinance adopted and all resolutions authorizing the expenditure of money or the entering into of a contract shall be subject to disapproval by the mayor as provided in section  31-16-104. Such an ordinance may provide or may be amended to provide that the mayor shall not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum or the requisite majority on any matter to be voted on by the council. Any such ordinance may be adopted, amended, or repealed only within the sixty days preceding the election of any mayor, to take effect upon such mayor's assumption of office.

The city council, at least as early as the last monthly meeting before such regular municipal election, shall fix by ordinance the compensation and fees of members of the city council, including the compensation of the mayor and councilmen, for the period for which they will be elected or appointed if any change in said compensation is desirable. The city council shall neither increase nor diminish the compensation of any councilman or mayor during his term of office. Each person appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of mayor or councilman shall receive the same compensation as was established for the office when the vacancy occurred. All other officers of the city, together with all other employees of the city, shall receive such compensation as the city council may fix from time to time by ordinance or as may be established in a pay plan adopted by ordinance. The city council may from time to time contract for professional services and for such services pay such fees and charges as may be agreed upon.

     <p>
      The city council shall appoint a city manager who shall be the chief administrative officer of the city. The city manager shall be chosen solely on the basis of his executive and administrative qualifications and need not, when appointed, be a resident of the city or of the state. No member of the city council shall be chosen as city manager during his term of office. The city manager shall be appointed for an indefinite term, but he may be removed at the pleasure of the city council for cause. Before the city manager may be removed, he shall be given, if he so demands, a written statement of the reasons alleged for his removal and he has the right to be heard thereon at a public meeting of the council prior to the final vote on the question of his removal. Pending and during such hearing, the city council may suspend him from office. The action of the city council in suspending or removing the city manager shall be final. It is the intent of this part 2 to vest all authority and to fix all responsibility for such suspension or removal in the city council. In case of the absence or disability of the city manager, the city council may designate some qualified person to perform the duties of the office during such absence or disability.

        Denial of hearing not violation of due process.
       </b>
       This section does not give rise to the type of expectancy to continued employment that serves as a ground for the existence of a property right protected by the fourteenth amendment. Therefore, no due process violation occurs in denying an employee a hearing on the city manager's decision to suspend or dismiss him. This is true regardless of whether the employee was gratuitously afforded an administrative hearing by the city manager, the procedural aspects of which were objected to by the employee. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1977
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section clearly indicates that an employee holds his position subject to the final decision of the city manager. The general assembly thereby specifically excluded the necessity of providing any procedure for an administrative hearing either before or after the city manager's decision. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1977
       </cite>
       ).

       <b>
        This section does not restrict the city manager's power to remove employees for particular causes.

       <cite class="co_code">

       ).

      <p>
       <b>
        The addition of the words "for cause" does not automatically create a constitutionally protected property right.
       </b>
       The entire statutory purpose must be considered in making such a determination. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1977
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And public employment is generally not such right.
       </b>
       Except in certain situations, as where an employee has formal tenure rights, public employment is generally not a constitutionally protected property interest. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1977
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       An allegation that the city and city manager infringed a constitutionally protected liberty interest when they terminated plaintiff's employment for reasons that affected his reputation and ability to obtain other employment opportunities was prima facie insufficient to state a claim that defendants violated a liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment since every suspension or dismissal will necessarily affect one's community reputation and will make it more difficult to obtain future employment. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1977

        The "for cause" language in this section requires only that the city manager's decision not be arbitrary.

        The power to remove employees included the power to suspend employees.

        It is unclear whether the general assembly intended subsection (2) to confer on employees a protected property interest in continued employment.
       </b>
       The statute's title and its language suggest that the legislature did not intend this particular statute to confer upon city employees an interest in their jobs. Rather, the legislature may have intended to clarify the powers of the city manager. Derda v. Brighton, Colo., City of, 53 F.3d 1162 (10th Cir. 1995).

       <b>
        Constitutional grounds for removal.
       </b>
       Under this section the holder of an elective office, duly elected by the people, should not be removed except for official misconduct, such misconduct as affects the performance of his duties as an officer, and for offenses against the corporation of a character directly affecting its rights and interests, and this conclusion is clearly sustainable on constitutional grounds. Bd. of Trustees v. People ex rel. Keith, 13 Colo. App. 553, 59 P. 72 (1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The power of removal must be exercised under the same limitations, precautions, and sanctions as in other judicial proceedings,
       </b>
       and the regularity of the proceedings and the legality of the removal must always be open to review in the courts. Bd. of Trustees v. People ex rel. Keith, 13 Colo. App. 553, 59 P. 72 (1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Mere recital in board minutes insufficient.
       </b>
       Upon proceedings in mandamus, to contest the right of removal, it is incumbent upon the person or persons attempting to remove respondent to show that such charges were preferred, and that they were sustained by legal evidence, and the mere recital in the minutes of the board that there was evidence offered, and that the board found the accused guilty is not sufficient. Bd. of Trustees v. People ex rel. Keith, 13 Colo. App. 553, 59 P. 72 (1899).

       <b>
        Officer not within section.
       </b>
       When no ordinance had ever been adopted by a town creating an office of deputy marshal and a plaintiff had never been hired or appointed other than as a deputy marshal, then he is not one of those town officers who is entitled to the protection of the removal provisions of the statute, and therefore he can be summarily discharged.

        Implicit right to discharge.

       Trial court found defendant became a resident of

In case a watcher must leave the polling place, he may designate an alternate to act in his behalf while he is absent, if such alternate is made known to the election judges by an affidavit of the person first named as a watcher.

All persons who are engaged in the processing and counting of the ballots shall be deputized in writing and take an oath that they will faithfully perform their assigned duties. If any ballot is damaged or defective so that it cannot properly be counted by the electronic vote counting equipment, a true duplicate copy shall be made of the damaged ballot in the presence of two witnesses. The duplicate ballot shall be substituted for the damaged ballot. All duplicate ballots shall be clearly labeled as such and shall bear a serial number which shall be recorded on the damaged ballot.

If the voter has cast more votes for the office than he is lawfully entitled to vote, the word "void" shall be written across the write-in vote, and it shall not be counted. Votes cast for a nominated candidate whose name appears on the ballot shall not be voided because of an invalid write-in vote for the same office.

A receipt for the ballots thus delivered shall be given by the election judge who receives them. The receipt shall be filed with the clerk, who shall also keep a record of the time when and the manner in which each of said packages was sent and delivered. The election judge receiving such package shall produce the same, with the seal unbroken, in the proper polling place at the opening of the polls on election day and, in the presence of all election judges for the precinct, shall open the package.

       Since the general assembly intended to make the municipal election code, which expressly provides for absentee ballots, applicable generally to municipal elections, and since the municipal election code provides that the municipal election code should be construed liberally so that all legally qualified electors may be permitted to vote, we hold that the municipal election code by its terms authorized the absentee ballots in an annexation election.

Any recount conducted pursuant to this subsection (1) shall be completed no later than the fifteenth day following the election and shall be paid for by the governing body.

      Irregularities or defects in the mode of calling, giving notice of, convening, holding, or conducting any regular or special election constitutes no defense to a prosecution for a violation of this article. When an offense is committed in relation to any municipal election, an indictment, information, or complaint for such offense is sufficient if it alleges that such election was authorized by law, without stating the call or notice of the election, the names of the judges of election holding such election, or the names of the persons voted for at such election. Judicial notice shall be taken of the holding of any regular or special election.

It is not the intention of the general assembly to limit or abridge in any manner these powers but rather to properly safeguard, protect, and preserve inviolate for municipal electors these modern instrumentalities of democratic government.

       Within forty days after an initiative or referendum petition is filed, a protest in writing under oath may be filed in the office of the clerk by any registered elector who resides in the municipality, setting forth specifically the grounds for such protest. The grounds for protest may include, but shall not be limited to, the failure of any portion of a petition or circulator affidavit to meet the requirements of this article. No signature may be challenged that is not identified in the protest by section and line number. The clerk shall forthwith mail a copy of such protest to the persons designated as representing the petition proponents pursuant to section  31-11-106 (2) and to the protester, together with a notice fixing a time for hearing such protest that is not less than five or more than ten days after such notice is mailed.

       Every hearing shall be held before the clerk with whom such protest is filed. The clerk shall serve as hearing officer unless some other person is designated by the legislative body as the hearing officer, and the testimony in every such hearing shall be under oath. The hearing officer shall have the power to issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses. The hearing shall be summary and not subject to delay and shall be concluded within sixty days after the petition is filed. No later than five days after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written determination of whether the petition is sufficient or not sufficient. If the hearing officer determines that a petition is not sufficient, the officer shall identify those portions of the petition that are not sufficient and the reasons therefor. The result of the hearing shall be forthwith certified to the protester and to the persons designated as representing the petition proponents pursuant to section  31-11-106 (2). The determination as to petition sufficiency may be reviewed by the district court for the county in which such municipality or portion thereof is located upon application of the protester, the persons designated as representing the petition proponents pursuant to section  31-11-106 (2), or the municipality, but such review shall be had and determined forthwith.

Subject to the requirements imposed by section  31-12-105 (1)(e), contiguity may be established by the annexation of one or more parcels in a series, which annexations may be completed simultaneously and considered together for the purposes of the public hearing required by sections  31-12-108 and  31-12-109 and the annexation impact report required by section  .5.

The provisions of section  31-12-116 (2) and (4) and section  31-12-117 shall not apply to such an annexation. Judicial review of such an annexation may be sought by any municipality having a plan in place pursuant to section  31-12-105 (1)(e) directly affected by such annexation, in addition to those described in section  31-12-116 (1). Such review may be, but need not be, instituted prior to the effective date of the annexing ordinance and may include injunctive relief. Such review shall be brought no later than sixty days after the effective date of the annexing ordinance or shall forever be barred.

       Rather, interpretation of subsection (1) is a question of law for the courts to decide, and judicial review is therefore de novo. Accordingly, in determining whether the roadways at issue are open space for purposes of subsection (1)(a), the county's designation is not binding. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City of Aurora, 62 P.3d 1049 (Colo. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Property at issue designated by the county has been improved through grading and surfacing and serves as public roadways. A parcel consisting entirely of roadway is not "essentially unimproved" and, therefore, is not open space within the meaning of subsection (1)(a). Because the county roads here are not open space, they do not affect contiguity under the terms of this section. Hence, the court erred in voiding the annexation of the two parcels for failure to satisfy the contiguity requirement. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City of Aurora, 62 P.3d 1049 (Colo. App. 2002).

        Municipal annexation of property does not automatically remove property from all other political subdivisions.

       Municipal annexation of property detaches the property from the unincorporated portion of a county but does not automatically remove the property from other political subdivisions, particularly where other statutory provisions govern such removal. Municipal annexation of property within the boundaries of a regional transportation authority therefore does not remove the property from the authority and the authority may continue to levy its sales tax on taxable transactions conducted on the property.

        Where the owners of a tract own all of a half-section, a railroad track passed diagonally through the northeast corner of this half-section, it was apparent that the triangular piece of land lying north and east of the track was physically separated from the larger parcel, and this piece was not included in the area proposed to be annexed, assuming that this was a right-of-way grant to a railroad by the congress and therefore it was not a mere easement but a limited fee with right of exclusive use and possession, as a result, the triangular tract was effectively separated by the congressional grant and the annexation did not "separate" the half-section within the meaning of subsection (1)(a).

         Legislative intent.

        In enacting subsection (1)(d) of this section, the general assembly intended to empower school boards to protect themselves against having involuntarily to undertake responsibility for providing educational services in newly annexed areas.

         Formal written consent required.
        </b>
        This section explicitly requires, in annexation involving school property, "the written consent of the board of education" of the school district involved, and faced with the clear mandate of the statute, we are not at liberty to hold that, in some cases, the giving of the required consent is but a ministerial act, not requiring formal action by the board.

         Ordinance invalid due to lack of consent.
        </b>
        Where on the date of final passage of the annexation ordinance here, the effective date thereof, no valid written consent of the board of education had been obtained, the ordinance was invalid when passed, and no action or resolution purporting to ratify the superintendent's consent taken by the board of education thereafter could, in and of itself, breathe life into this dead ordinance.

        <b>
         Later ratification invalid.
        </b>
        The school board's resolution consenting to the annexation of its property and ratifying the action of the superintendent in signing the annexation petition does not satisfy the express requirement that the written consent of the school board be obtained before any territory which includes school property can be annexed.

        There is not absolute constitutional right under the due process clause to vote on a proposed annexation,

       and the state general assembly has the ultimate control of the method of annexing by its agency cities. The general assembly may grant the right to vote in some types of annexation and deny it in others, provided that there is some rational basis for the distinction, and the equal protection clause of the federal constitution does not preclude creation of distinct classes if such classifications are reasonably related to some legitimate state interest and all those within the class created are treated equally. Therefore, within each of the present classes based on the extent of contiguous boundaries all persons residing within the territory to be annexed are treated equally with respect to the right to exercise the franchise, and the distinction recognized by the assembly as to when the franchise may be exercised is reasonable in light of the manifest purpose for the differentiation.

       Where the area to be annexed has less than two-thirds contiguity with the annexing city, the interrelationship between the annexed area and the city may not be great enough to warrant a politically undesirable unilateral merger; where, however, the territory to be annexed has over two-thirds contiguity with the annexing city, the interrelationship between the two areas is or can be so close that the city should be allowed to annex despite the unwillingness of the residents of the annexed territory. The law thus recognizes that a municipality such as Colorado Springs is severely handicapped by an annexation law which requires the approval of the property owners and qualified electors of an annexed area, it being unable to deal with groups of citizens who form small tax colonies on the borders of the core city which is the economic base of the urban area and to which the colonies owe their very existence and yet pay nothing for the advantages which the city provides, as these people would seldom consent to the annexation and their nonconsent would threaten the very existence of the core city.

        The regional transportation district (RTD) and the Douglas county soil conservation district (DCSCD) are not special districts to whom notice of the annexation hearing must be given under subsection (2).
       </b>
       Subsection (2) requires, among other things, that the annexing municipality provide notice of the annexation hearing to any special district having territory within the area to be annexed. For purposes of this subsection, a "special district" means any quasi-municipal corporation and political subdivision organized or acting pursuant to the provisions of the Special District Act, article 1 of title 32. Here, RTD and DCSCD were not created and do not act pursuant to the Special District Act. Rather, each was created and operates pursuant to its own enabling legislation. Such legislation refers to both entities as "districts" but not "special districts". Accordingly, the district court incorrectly voided the annexation because of the city's failure to give notice to these districts. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City of Aurora, 62 P.3d 1049 (Colo.

       When the city and county of Denver is the only city in the state whose boundaries are coexistent with those of the school district, the trial court can take judicial notice that the only occasion upon which annexation will cause territory in Colorado to be detached from one school district and attached to another is when territory is annexed by the city and county of Denver, such being the case, there is no necessity for evidence to support the finding concerning school districts in proceedings not involving Denver.

        Nonresident landowner may vote.
       </b>
       In view of the specific provision in subsection (2) that a landowner may vote irrespective of whether he is a qualified elector, which entails residency, and the further recognition in subsection (5) that qualified electors and landowners may be two separate groups, both entitled to vote, the supreme court concludes that the general assembly intended to permit a nonresident landowner to vote in an annexation election, because the specific provisions must be held to prevail over the general provisions, and to the extent that this construction conflicts with the residency requirements of the municipal election code, those provisions are held to be superseded by the provisions of the annexation act.

       Since the municipal election code provides that such code should be construed liberally so that all legally qualified electors may be permitted to vote, we hold that the municipal election code by its terms authorized the absentee ballots in an annexation election.

       Since the statute states only that the zoning ordinance shall not be passed prior to the annexation ordinance, the statute does not preclude the two ordinances from being passed at the same time. Cline v. City of Boulder, 168

In this respect they were not legislating on procedure but declaring by substantive law a legal status. City of Westminster v. District Court, 167

      If any actions, suits, or proceedings are pending against any one of the cities or towns at the time of the consolidation, the consolidated city or town shall be substituted as plaintiff or defendant in such action, suit, or proceeding. The same shall thenceforth proceed as if the claim, right, debt, or demand upon which said action, suit, or proceeding was founded had originally existed in favor of or against such consolidated town or city. In like manner, any person who, at the date of consolidation, has any claim, demand, or right of action against any one or more of the cities or towns so consolidating may bring any action, suit, or proceeding necessary for the collection or enforcement thereof after such consolidation against the consolidated city or town in the same manner as though the claim, demand, or right of action had originally existed against such consolidated city or town. In no case shall any tax be levied upon or liability incurred by any property or persons on account of such actions, suits, proceedings, debts, liabilities, or rights of action, except those persons and property which would have been liable for the same in case no consolidation had taken place. The governing body of the consolidated city or town has the power to levy a special tax upon persons and property within the former limits of the city or town against which such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand, or right of action existed for the payment, liquidation, or settlement thereof or of any judgment founded thereon. The terms of consolidation may make other provisions for the payment of such demands, liabilities, and judgments.

     <p>
      When the governing body of such municipality levies a tax upon the property within such municipality for the purpose of paying such indebtedness or any part thereof or interest thereon, such governing body may levy a tax at the same rate and for the same purpose on the land so disconnected. The county treasurer shall pay over to such municipality all moneys collected by the treasurer on account of such tax, to be applied only to the payment of such indebtedness. In case the owner of any land so disconnected pays off and discharges a portion of such indebtedness equal in amount to the same proportion of the indebtedness which the valuation for assessment of the land bears to the entire valuation for assessment of all the property subject to taxation for the payment of such indebtedness, calculated according to the last assessment previous to such payment, said land is exempted from further taxation to pay such indebtedness. Upon such payment being made, the canceled bonds or other evidences of payment of such portion of said indebtedness must be deposited with the treasurer of such municipality, and a certificate shall be given by the treasurer stating that such payment has been made.

       The argument that no land should be taken out of the corporate limits until all claims for taxes against it are adjusted, whether due or not, for such in effect is the contention of defendant in error, is without merit, because it is clear that, in any event, all taxes lawfully assessed against the land, prior to its disconnection, create a lien against it, and the land would be held for the payment of such taxes, as well after disconnection as before, and the provision that all taxes due at the time of the filing of the petition must be shown to have been paid, was simply to preclude owners from making such application when actually in default, and is a very wise and proper requirement. It was in no sense intended thereby to discriminate against such owners and compel them to pay taxes before other taxpayers are required to do so. Hendricks v. Town of Julesburg, 55

        Change in form of debt inconsequential.
       </b>
       The plaintiff contends that this section is so worded that the change of the form of the indebtedness precludes a taxation of the disconnected land that otherwise was within the contemplation of the section. What possible bearing the change in form of the debt would have, we are unable to conceive. The section says that the disconnected lands shall not be exempt from taxes for the purposes of paying any indebtedness lawfully contracted while the lands are within the limits of the town. The indebtedness now evidenced by the refunding bonds, was contracted while plaintiff's land was within these limits, and it makes no difference that the original form of the debt has been changed into a judgment, then into funding, and then into refunding, bonds. Town of Aurora v. Watkins, 77

       </cite>
       , 236 P. 556 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the purchasers of the original bond issue acquired the water bonds the law was, and the bonds so stated, that all the property within the limits of the town was subject to taxation for raising a fund to pay the bonded debt, and even had the general assembly explicitly enacted a disconnecting statute that property within the town when the debt was contracted shall, after disconnection, be exempt from taxation for the purpose of paying the bonded debt, the act would be unconstitutional.

        Rule not of symmetry but of contiguity.
       </b>
       Although the supreme court has held that no disconnection of land can be upheld which divides a town into two areas wholly isolated from each other, where the creation of a "corridor" has the effect of making the town's boundaries somewhat irregular, but, the area concerned remains contiguous to the rest of the town with the same access to all parts of the town as existed before the disconnection, it is not wholly isolated, the rule is not one of symmetry, but of contiguity.

Upon such payment being made, the canceled bonds or other evidences of payment of such portion of said indebtedness shall be deposited with the treasurer of such town, and a certificate shall be given by him stating that such payment has been made.

       Municipal ordinances for road improvement project that eliminated parking on the municipality's right-of-way near a condominium were a reasonable exercise of the municipality's police powers.

The measures were a reasonable exercise of that power because they were reasonably related to the municipality's objectives of improving traffic safety, improving water drainage, and remedying a missing portion of a recreational bike path. In examining the reasonableness of the relationship, a court does not compare or otherwise examine alternative methods for addressing the government objective. Town of Dillon v. Yacht Club Condo.

       It is not for the supreme court to substitute its notions as to what is fair and reasonable, but to ascertain under all existing circumstances whether the standard established by the city is in fact reasonable and bears a reasonable relation to the public health, welfare, and safety of the city and its inhabitants. And while it might be desirable to classify service stations as to the capacity of the truck which may make delivery there, or to promulgate some other reasonable regulations applying to retail services stations based on their specific location in certain fire zones, the supreme court held that an ordinance which requires the tank vehicles to pass through the city to a bulk plant, unload at the bulk plant, and then reload vehicles and a capacity of less than 2,200 gallons for redelivery to retail filling stations throughout the city, necessarily involves a greater exposure to hazard and accident, and therefore a greater danger to the public health, welfare, and safety of the city and its populace.

        Recital in municipal bonds that they were issued in accordance with the provisions of the enabling statute imports that they were sent forth in pursuant of a lawful and proper resolution or ordinance and of just and proper action by the governing board of a municipality.

        In cases where special assessments are authorized, the city council may prescribe the rule of apportionment, having reference to the special benefits accruing to the property by reason of the improvement, the same to be such as will secure an assessment in proportion to the benefits accruing as nearly as practicable.

         Mode of assessment proper.
        </b>
        When the property consists of lots of substantially equal depth abutting the local improvement, and there is nothing in the nature and circumstances of the particular case showing that an assessment in proportion to the frontage of the lots upon the improvement would work manifest injustice, such a mode of assessment should be upheld.

         Authority for lien must be by ordinance.

        A municipal corporation cannot acquire a lien on town lots for unpaid water assessments unless and until the adoption of an ordinance authorizing such a lien under this subdivision. Ordway v. Kaiser, 90
        <cite class="co_code">

       <p>
        Foreclosure of a trust deed cuts out all junior liens, including statutory liens, unless these be specifically excluded, hence the lien of a municipality for water assessments authorized under subsection (1)(e) is not superior to that of a trust deed on the property affected unless it attached under appropriate ordinance prior to the recording of the trust deed.

         Application of subsection (1)(a) to privies.
        </b>
        Subsection (1)(a) gave the city sufficient authority to compel all buildings embraced within the power to connect with the sewer. It also confers ample power to prohibit the keeping of any privy within a sewer district, or within 400 feet of the sewer; but this does not mean the city has power to compel one who does not desire to make the connection to connect an outside or open privy or vault with the sewer. It can prohibit the maintenance and use of the privy, and can fine the keeper and abate the nuisance, if it is a nuisance, and can compel owners of buildings to connect with the sewer. This would seem sufficient power to rid any sewer district of all privies and vaults, and to compel owners to connect all buildings with the sewer. Gault v. City of Ft. Collins, 57

       Municipal ordinances for road improvement project that eliminated parking on the municipality's right-of-way near a condominium were a reasonable exercise of the municipality's police powers. The ordinances were within the municipality's police power to regulate matters of public health, safety, and welfare. The measures were a reasonable exercise of that power because they were reasonably related to the municipality's objectives of improving traffic safety, improving water drainage, and remedying a missing portion of a recreational bike path.

        U.S. supreme court's contemporary regulatory takings jurisprudence makes clear that the relevant inquiries for due process and takings claims are distinct.

      Any municipality may aid in the construction and repair of any highway leading thereto by appropriating a portion of the highway tax belonging to said municipality, not exceeding fifty percent thereof annually, as provided in this section. When a petition signed by twenty of the registered electors of said municipality asking that the question of aiding in the construction or repair of any highway leading thereto be submitted to the registered electors thereof is presented to the governing body, the governing body immediately shall give notice of a special election. Said notice shall specify the date of such election, the particular highway proposed to be aided, and the proportion of the highway tax then levied and not expended or next thereafter to be levied to be appropriated. The election shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the "Colorado Municipal Election Code of 1965". The question on the ballot or voting machine tabs shall be "Appropriation" or "No appropriation". If a majority of the votes polled are for appropriation, the governing body may aid in the construction and repair of said highway to the extent of the appropriation in the same manner as they otherwise would if said highway were within the municipal limits of said municipality. No part of such highway tax shall be expended more than two miles from the limits of such municipality.

         Primary object of subsection (1)(a)
        </b>
        is to permit the inhabitants of towns and cities to secure an adequate supply of pure water, a paramount necessity more important than all other public utilities and absolutely necessary for the sustenance of life, the preservation of health, and the protection of property. The general assembly desired to invest the people, who were themselves to bear the burdens of the expense, with every power necessary to supply this imperative want, but the general assembly itself could not determine and fix upon some one invariable mode or manner by which this supply was to be obtained, for the obvious reasons that too many conditions were to be considered; that what would be proper, necessary, and entirely satisfactory at one town would be entirely impracticable in another, and the inhabitants of one municipality might feel perfectly able to supply their own wants, while those of another might feel wholly unable to assume this burden.

        Subsection (1)(a) was intended to vest, and does vest in the authorities of cities and towns, entire discretion as to the use of any and all of the means specified in the statute to supply the city or town with water, and the fact that a city or town has granted to a private party or corporation a franchise to construct waterworks to supply the city or town does not preclude the city or town from afterwards constructing waterworks of its own.

        Although an ordinance granting the right to a private corporation to operate a lighting plant in the city by its terms fails to reserve the right to the city to purchase or condemn the plant, nevertheless, the provision of subsection (1)(a) to that effect will be read into and made a part of the ordinance.

        It was not the intention of the general assembly to require the approving vote of the majority of the taxpayers of a city every time its council issued a license to a corporation, partnership, or person to erect or install a gas plant or an electric light plant upon its premises for domestic or business uses.

The failure of a city or town to collect for any one or more years a sufficient sum to discharge its obligation for water rents could not extinguish its liability on the contract.

        Exercise of legislative police power.

       A city council, in establishing a sewer district, exercises a legislative power for police purposes, having its origin in the taxing power. Wolff v. City of Denver, 20 Colo. App. 135, 77 P. 364 (1904).

        Subsection (1)(a) limits the powers of municipal corporations in relation to sewers to those expressed in said paragraph

       and an ordinance purporting to grant to a private person an exclusive right and privilege to construct and operate a system of sewers within the limits of a municipal corporation and to collect from all persons using the same a reasonable annual compensation for connecting therewith is absolutely void, and one constructing a sewer system under such ordinance cannot maintain an action against an inhabitant of the city for the use of the same.

       The judgment of the city council as to the extent of a sewer district and the properties to be included therein, when acting within the scope of the authority conferred by subsection (1)(a), is conclusive, unless it clearly appears that their action was fraudulent or unreasonable, and whoever assails the action of the city council has the burden of proof.

       <b>
        Power to subject outside lands to eminent domain not implied.
       </b>
       Under subsection (1)(a), the giving of the right to construct sewers does not also grant authority to subject outside lands to the operation of eminent domain, because such power is not implied because there is nothing in out statutes to even indicate, much less imply, such purpose.

        Liability for ministerial acts.

       Whenever the duty as respects drains and sewers ceases to be legislative or judicial or quasi-judicial, and becomes ministerial, then, although there be no statute giving the action, a municipal corporation is liable to the same extent and on the same principle as a private person or corporation would be under like circumstances for the negligent discharge or the negligent omission to discharge such duty, resulting in an injury to others.

      All work done by the city in the construction of works of public improvement of five thousand dollars or more shall be done by contract to the lowest responsible bidder on open bids after ample advertisement. It shall be unlawful for any person to divide a works of public improvement construction into two or more separate projects for the sole purpose of evading or attempting to evade the requirement that works of public improvement construction costing five thousand dollars or more be submitted to open bidding, unless the total cost of any such project would be less if divided into two or more projects than if submitted to open bidding as one project. If no bids are received or if, in the opinion of the city council, all bids received are too high, the city may enter into negotiations concerning the contract. No negotiated price shall exceed the lowest responsible bid previously received. The city is not required to advertise for and receive bids for such technical, professional, or incidental assistance as it may deem wise to employ in guarding the interest of the city against the neglect of contractors in the performance of such work.

        The only power formerly possessed by a town over property was the power "to sell and dispose of" it
       </b>
       and nothing short of a deed of conveyance was a compliance with the statute because the term "sell and dispose of" as used in this statute meant to get rid of, to finish with, to fully relinquish all interest in the property, to transfer and convey the same. Centennial Props., Inc. v. City of Littleton, 154

        But a city could properly convey real property, yet retain a possibility of reverter to it,
       </b>
       because possibility of reverter is merely the possibility that the land will come back to the grantor, and the holder of a bare possibility of reverter did not have a present "vested" interest or "estate" in the land. City of Idaho Springs v. Golden Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 29

        Subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) demonstrate a legislative intent to distinguish between property held or used for any governmental purpose, the sale of which must be approved by election, and any other real estate, which may be sold by ordinance.
       </b>
       Although town held subject property for several years, it did not use or hold it for any governmental purpose. Although town entered into lease and option agreement in the context of relocating town hall to the subject property, the contingencies for construction failed to materialize. Therefore, the applicable statutory provision was subsection (1)(b), which applies to "any other real estate", and not subsection (1)(a), which applies to property held for "any governmental purpose". Because town did not use or hold subject property for any governmental purpose, no election was required for the approval of its sale. New Stanley Assocs., LLLP v. Town of Estes Park, 200 P.3d 1118 (Colo. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consideration of potential uses for subject property, without any dedication to a particular use, is not a governmental purpose within the meaning of subsection (1)(a). Moreover, town's retention of subject property for the purpose of using its sale proceeds for construction of infrastructure for a performing arts center site is not a governmental purpose. The relevant statutory provisions address the use or purpose for which real estate is held and not the use or purpose of the proceeds from its sale. Further, appropriation of public funds for the acquisition of subject property does not mean the property is held for a governmental purpose. The general assembly has recognized two types of property in subsection (1), and the distinction is not based on the method of appropriation of funds for the property. Equating the acquisition of property by means of appropriated municipal funds pursuant to §

The obligation to pay such rentals shall not constitute an indebtedness of said municipality within the meaning of the constitutional limitations on contracting of indebtedness by municipalities.

     <p>
      If all the procedures and requirements of this part 2 are complied with, any municipality may enact any ordinance which adopts any code by reference in whole or in part, and such primary code thus adopted may in turn adopt by reference, in whole or in part, any secondary codes duly described therein. However, every primary code which is incorporated in any such adopting ordinance shall be specified in the title of the ordinance. Notwithstanding the procedures and requirements of this part 2, a municipality may enact any ordinance which adopts by reference any statute, rule, regulation, or standard adopted by the federal government or the state of Colorado, or by any agency of either of them, solely by referring to such statute, rule, regulation, or standard in the text of such ordinance.

       Where a special sewer tax was assessed against a city lot but no record thereof was made either in the office of the county treasurer or county clerk, and 12 years after such assessment was made the city attempted to enforce its lien by causing said lot to be sold for said tax, the city was estopped to assert its tax lien as against a purchaser of the lot who purchased without notice of such tax and after an examination of the records for tax liens, and who received no notice of the tax or the tax sale until the purchaser at the tax sale applied for a deed upon his tax sale certificate, the holder of the tax sale certificate was not entitled to a deed and the tax lien and certificate should be annulled.

For the purpose of reimbursing such general revenues and for the payment of subsequently accruing interest, the governing body issuing such funding bonds or the proper tax assessing and collecting officers upon whom shall devolve the duty of levying and collecting municipal taxes shall levy annually a sufficient tax upon all of the taxable property in the municipality fully to discharge such interest. For the ultimate redemption of such funding bonds, there shall be levied annually such a tax upon all the taxable property in such municipality as will create a fund sufficient to discharge each annual installment of such funding bonds at the maturity thereof, which fund shall be called the redemption fund. All taxes for interest on and for the redemption of such bonds shall be paid in cash only and shall be kept by the municipal treasurer as a special fund to be used only in payment of the interest upon and for the redemption of such bonds. Such tax shall be levied and collected as other municipal taxes are levied and collected. The tax provisions for the ultimate redemption of such bonds shall be set forth in the ordinance authorizing their issue and shall set forth the years in which such taxes shall be levied for the creation of said redemption fund.

      The interest accruing on such refunding bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this part 2 prior to the time when the proceeds of tax levies are available therefor shall be paid out of the general revenues or any other revenues of the municipality available therefor. For the purpose of reimbursing such general revenues or other revenues and for the payment of subsequently accruing interest, the governing body issuing such refunding bonds shall certify and the board of county commissioners of the county in which the city or town is located shall levy, annually, a sufficient tax upon all the taxable property in the municipality fully to discharge such interest.

In the event the bonds to be redeemed and the interest thereon accruing would have been paid from taxes levied upon only part of the taxable property in the municipality, the taxes levied for payment or redemption of the refunding bonds and the interest accruing thereon shall be levied in the same manner and upon only the same taxable property as would have been levied for payment of the bonds to be refunded if no refunding of said bonds had been made and accomplished. As collected, all taxes levied for payment of interest on and for the payment or redemption of the principal of such bonds shall be kept by the treasurer of the municipality in a special fund to be used only in the payment of the interest upon and for the payment or redemption of the principal of such bonds. Such tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner as other municipal taxes are levied and collected. The ordinance authorizing the issuance of said bonds shall set forth the years in which such taxes shall be levied for the creation of said fund.

All the provisions of this part 2, including elections authorizing issuance of such refunding bonds, shall apply only within the former limits of the city or town which contracted such indebtedness. All refunding bonds so issued shall state in substance that they, together with interest thereon, are payable only by levies upon property situated within such limits as the same existed prior to such consolidation, unless the terms of consolidation shall provide that such refunding shall apply within the entire limits of the consolidated city or town.

      Any refunding bonds may be issued to refund one or more issues of outstanding bonds of a municipality, but no two or more issues of outstanding bonds may be refunded by a single issue of refunding bonds unless the taxable property upon which tax levies are being made for payment of each such outstanding issue of bonds is identical to the taxable property on which such levies are being made for the payment of all other outstanding bonds proposed to be refunded by such single issue of refunding bonds. In the event that two or more issues of outstanding bonds of a municipality are to be refunded by the issuance of a single issue of refunding bonds as provided in this section, the net interest cost and net effective interest rate on the bonds to be refunded shall be computed as if all of said bonds had originally been combined as a single issue aggregating the total of the smaller issues, and the results of this computation shall be compared with the net interest cost and net effective interest rate on the whole of the single refunding issue for purposes of determining the necessity of submitting the question of issuing such refunding bonds to a vote of the registered electors of the municipality.

       The section declares that all streets, etc., described as for public use on the map or plat of any city, or any additions, shall be deemed to be public property and the fee thereof vested in such city or town.

       It is the duty of the commission to make and adopt a master plan for the physical development of the municipality, including any areas outside its boundaries, subject to the approval of the governmental body having jurisdiction thereof, which in the commission's judgment bear relation to the planning of such municipality. The master plan of a municipality shall be an advisory document to guide land development decisions; however, the plan or any part thereof may be made binding by inclusion in the municipality's adopted subdivision, zoning, platting, planned unit development, or other similar land development regulations after satisfying notice, due process, and hearing requirements for legislative or quasi-judicial processes as appropriate. When a commission decides to adopt a master plan, the commission shall conduct public hearings, after notice of such public hearings has been published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in a manner sufficient to notify the public of the time, place, and nature of the public hearing, prior to final adoption of a master plan in order to encourage public participation in and awareness of the development of such plan and shall accept and consider oral and written public comments throughout the process of developing the plan.

Such regulations may provide for the proper arrangement of streets in relation to other existing or planned streets and to the master plan, for adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access of fire fighting apparatus, recreation, light, and air, and for the avoidance of congestion of population, including minimum area and width of lots. The regulations may also provide for waivers from subdivision requirements and may establish different requirements applicable to subdivisions of different sizes, densities, or types of dwelling units.

        Establishment of zoning district boundary lines in a legislative function.
       </b>
       Zoning necessarily requires the establishment of boundary lines between different districts and the selection of the boundary line is a legislative function with which courts should not interfere, and only where the determination of the zoning authority is so unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, and unjustifiable as to amount to a violation of constitutional rights are the courts permitted to interfere.

       The fact that, under zoning laws, adjoining properties in other districts may be put to different and possibly more advantageous uses does not afford a basis for concluding there is a denial of equal protection of the laws. Nopro Co. v. Town of Cherry Hills Vill., 180

The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by any administrative official charged with the enforcement of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this part 3. It shall also hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under such ordinance. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, the concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance, or to effect any variation in such ordinance. Every decision of such board shall be subject, however, to review by certiorari by the district court of the county within which the municipality or any part thereof is located.

Such appeal may be taken by any person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality.

Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of such ordinance, the board of adjustment has the power, in passing upon appeals, to vary or modify the application of the regulations or provisions of such ordinance relating to the use, construction, or alteration of buildings or structures, or the use of land, so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The governing body by ordinance may eliminate the board of adjustment's authority to grant use variances or use modifications, or may transfer that authority to some other board, agency, or commission, or to the governing body of the municipality. Where feasible, the board of adjustment may vary or modify the application of the regulations for the purpose of considering access to sunlight for solar energy devices.

        Public purpose.

       The acquisition of properties and the elimination of their slum or blighted character constitutes a public purpose; that what is involved is an urban reclamation project; and the fact that when the redevelopment is achieved the properties are sold to private individuals for the purpose of development does not rob the taking of its public purpose.

        Private ownership does not defeat public purpose.

       Although the general assembly's method is to be accomplished not by public ownership of the land but rather through private endeavor and ownership under the direction of authorized officials. The acquisition and transfer to private parties is a mere incident of the chief purpose of the act which is rehabilitation of the area. The fact that the property would not continue to be owned by the city does not mean that the use was not a public one. Rabinoff v. District Court, 145

The right to challenge the blight determination is not just a right to a hearing for its own sake, but a right to overturn a blight determination that was an abuse of discretion pursuant to this Urban Renewal Law.

        Due process requires a city to provide a property owner with direct notice of the adverse blight determination.
       </b>
       In contemporary terms this means notice had to be mailed, emailed, or personally served. An owner's ability to preserve its property right in the statutory right of review depends on its knowledge of the simple fact the blight finding exists. M.A.K. Inv. Grp., LLC v. City of Glendale, 897 F.3d 1303 (10th Cir. 2018).

       Even if owners can argue their property is not blighted if and when condemnation proceedings begin, that does not preserve the cause of action for immediate review of the blight determination itself. M.A.K. Inv. Grp., LLC v. City of Glendale, 897 F.3d 1303 (10th Cir. 2018).

        Basis for finding area blighted.
       </b>
       The fact that there were not widespread violations of building and health ordinances does not of itself establish arbitrariness on the part of the responsible authorities in the finding that the area was slum and blighted. Rabinoff v. District Court, 145
       <cite class="co_code">

        One well-kept building does not in itself defeat the determination of a blighted area.
       </b>
       If the building owned by plaintiff, be, as claimed, a magnificent victorian type edifice such would not in itself defeat the determination that the area, taken as a whole, is a slum and blighted area. Interstate Trust Bldg. Co. v. Denver Urban Renewal Auth., 172
       <cite class="co_code">

       <b>
        "Blighted area" construed.
       </b>
       The definition of "blighted area" contained in subsection (2) is broad and not only encompasses those areas containing properties so dilapidated as to justify condemnation as nuisances, but also envisions the prevention of deterioration. The absence of widespread violations of building and health ordinances does not of itself establish arbitrariness on the part of a city council in finding blight. Tracy v. City of Boulder, 635 P.2d 907 (Colo. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Determination of "blighted area" by council is legislative question.
       </b>
       A city council's determination as to whether an area is blighted, when such determination relates to the need for an ordinance, is a legislative question and scope of review by the judiciary is restricted. Tracy v. City of Boulder, 635 P.2d 907 (Colo. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        If actual purpose behind a particular urban renewal plan is not the elimination or prevention of blight or slums,
       </b>
       the urban renewal authority does not have the power to condemn land in furtherance of that plan because the determination of necessity is not supported by the record. City & County of Denver v. Block 173, 814 P.2d 824 (Colo. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Proper purpose for which a condemnation action may be instituted
       </b>
       in the context of urban renewal is limited to plans adopted to remedy identified slum or blight conditions, and fact that such conditions were found to exist is not dispositive if the purpose in designating a large study area and in targeting block 173 as part of that area was to acquire block 173 for private purposes. City & County of Denver v. Block 173, 814 P.2d 824 (Colo. 1991).

        Quarry lake property is no longer subject to municipality's 1981 blight determination, because the statutory procedures for removing blight were followed.
       </b>
       The urban renewal authority disposed of the quarry lake property according to the terms of state's urban renewal law and certified the uses to which the lake was devoted comported with the urban renewal plan. After duly disposing of the lake property, certifying that the property was being used in accordance with the urban renewal plan, and having notice at all relevant times of the developer's efforts to incorporate the lake into its office park, the urban renewal authority cannot now claim that the lake has never been developed in accordance with the urban renewal plan. On the contrary, the quarry lake has been developed in accordance with the procedures laid out in the state's urban renewal law and, thus, can no longer be considered "blighted" under the municipality's 1981 blight determination.

After such a hearing, if the governing body finds that one or more slum or blighted areas exist in the municipality, and finds that the acquisition, clearance, rehabilitation, conservation, development, or redevelopment, or a combination thereof of such area is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, morals, or welfare of the residents of the municipality, and declares it to be in the public interest that the urban renewal authority for such municipality created by this part 1 exercise the powers provided in this part 1 to be exercised by such authority, the governing body shall adopt a resolution so finding and declaring and shall cause notice of such resolution to be given to the mayor, who shall thereupon appoint, as provided in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section, commissioners to act as an authority. A certificate signed by such commissioners shall then be filed with the division of local government in the department of local affairs and there remain of record, setting forth that the governing body made the findings and declaration provided in this paragraph (b) after such hearing and that the mayor has appointed them as commissioners. Upon the filing of such certificate, the commissioners and their successors are constituted an urban renewal authority, which shall be a body corporate and politic. The boundaries of such authority shall be coterminous with those of the municipality.

        No clear indication in subsection (1)(e) of an urban renewal authority's powers to place the decision to condemn in the hands of a private party.
       </b>
       The Urban Renewal Law mentions many conventional matters that urban renewal authorities could effectuate only through contracts with private parties. No provision, however, suggests that urban renewal authorities may, through contract, delegate to private parties the prerogative of taking property by eminent domain. Subsection (1)(e) speaks of exercising the power of eminent domain "in the manner provided by the laws of this state", none of which authorizes the delegation of that power by contract to private entities. Grants of power to exercise the sovereign right of eminent domain, in derogation of the common private rights of individuals, are generally strictly construed. Cornerstone Group XXII v. Wheat Ridge Urban Renewal Auth., 151 P.3d 601 (Colo. App. 2006), rev'd on other grounds, 176 P.3d 737 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Because district court lacked authority to order the specific performance of a contractual obligation to exercise the core governmental power of eminent domain and urban renewal authority could not be estopped from abandoning its condemnation petitions, judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.
       </b>
       However, because authority's agreement to acquire specific properties by condemnation, if necessary, does not render the contract void under reserved powers doctrine, case is remanded and district court directed to consider respondent's remaining claims, including breach of contract. Wheat Ridge Urban Renewal Auth. v. Cornerstone Group XXII, 176 P.3d 737 (Colo. 2007).

        No clear indication in section of an urban renewal authority's powers to place the decision to condemn in the hands of a private party.
       </b>
       The Urban Renewal Law mentions many conventional matters that urban renewal authorities could effectuate only though contracts with private parties. No provision, however, suggests that urban renewal authorities may, through contract, delegate to private parties the prerogative of taking property by eminent domain. Purpose of this section is to restrict eminent domain when used to acquire private property for transfer to another private party. Grants of power to exercise the sovereign right of eminent domain, in derogation of the common private rights of individuals, are generally strictly construed. Cornerstone Group XXII v. Wheat Ridge Urban Renewal Auth., 151 P.3d 601 (Colo. App. 2006), rev'd on other grounds, 176 P.3d 737 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Because district court lacked authority to order the specific performance of a contractual obligation to exercise the core governmental power of eminent domain and urban renewal authority could not be estopped from abandoning its condemnation petitions, judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.
       </b>
       However, because authority's agreement to acquire specific properties by condemnation, if necessary, does not render the contract void under reserved powers doctrine, case is remanded and district court directed to consider respondent's remaining claims, including breach of contract.

The purchasers, lessees, transferees, and their successors and assigns are obligated to devote such real property only to the land uses, designs, building requirements, timing, or procedure specified in the urban renewal plan and may be obligated to comply with such other requirements as the authority may determine to be in the public interest, including the obligation to begin within a reasonable time any improvements on such real property required by the urban renewal plan. Such real property or interest shall be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred at not less than its fair value (as determined by the authority) for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan, an authority shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in such plan; the restrictions upon and the covenants, conditions, and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee; and the objectives of such plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas. Real property acquired by an authority which, in accordance with the provisions of the urban renewal plan, is to be transferred shall be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with the carrying out of the provisions of the urban renewal plan.

Such notice shall identify the area, or portion thereof, and shall state that such further information as is available may be obtained at the office designated in the notice. The authority shall consider all such redevelopment or rehabilitation proposals and the financial and legal ability of the persons making such proposals to carry them out and may negotiate with any persons for proposals for the purchase, lease, or other transfer of any real property acquired by the authority in the urban renewal area. The authority may accept such proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this part 1; except that a notification of intention to accept such proposal shall be filed with the governing body not less than fifteen days prior to any such acceptance.

        Trial court correctly held that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue claims alleging a violation of state Urban Renewal Law.
       </b>
       A plaintiff has standing if he or she (1) incurred an injury in fact (2) to a legally protected interest, as contemplated by statutory or constitutional provisions. To satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the controlling test for standing, the injury must be direct and palpable. A claimed injury that, as here, is presently speculative and that cannot be determined until a remote time in the future is not sufficiently direct and palpable to support a finding of injury in fact. To determine whether plaintiff has a legal interest that entitles her to judicial redress, court must consider whether Urban Renewal Law reflects a legislative purpose to confer such an interest. Court finds that general assembly did not intend to create a right in taxpayers to enforce the statute. Implying such a right in taxpayers is also inconsistent with the statutory scheme. Olson v. City of Golden, 53 P.3d 747 (Colo. App. 2002).

        Urban renewal authority lacks statutory authority to condemn subject parcel of real property that is no longer subject to blight determination.
       </b>
       Neither lake parcel nor Arvada marketplace parcel is subject to municipality's 1981 blight finding. Once the purpose of eliminating or preventing the spread of blight has been achieved, the urban renewal authority may no longer rely on a municipality's initial blight determination to condemn property because it can no longer exercise its condemnation powers in furtherance of a valid public purpose. Thus, the statutory basis for the urban renewal authority's power to condemn, the elimination of blight, is no longer present. Accordingly, where blight has been eliminated from a parcel that lies within an urban renewal area, an urban renewal authority no longer has any statutory basis to exercise its condemnation power over or for the benefit of that parcel.

        Subject real property is no longer subject to municipality's 1981 blight determination, because the statutory procedures for removing blight were followed.
       </b>
       The urban renewal authority disposed of the quarry lake property according to the terms of state's urban renewal law and certified the uses to which the lake was devoted comported with the urban renewal plan. After duly disposing of the lake property, certifying that the property was being used in accordance with the urban renewal plan, and having notice at all relevant times of the developer's efforts to incorporate the lake into its office park, the urban renewal authority cannot now claim that the lake has never been developed in accordance with the urban renewal plan. On the contrary, the quarry lake has been developed in accordance with the procedures laid out in the state's urban renewal law and, thus, can no longer be considered "blighted" under the municipality's 1981 blight determination.

       <b>
        Urban renewal authority lacks statutory authority to condemn subject parcel of real property that is no longer subject to blight determination.
       </b>
       Neither lake parcel nor Arvada marketplace parcel is subject to municipality's 1981 blight finding. Once the purpose of eliminating or preventing the spread of blight has been achieved, the urban renewal authority may no longer rely on a municipality's initial blight determination to condemn property because it can no longer exercise its condemnation powers in furtherance of a valid public purpose. Thus, the statutory basis for the urban renewal authority's power to condemn, the elimination of blight, is no longer present. Accordingly, where blight has been eliminated from a parcel that lies within an urban renewal area, an urban renewal authority no longer has any statutory basis to exercise its condemnation power over or for the benefit of that parcel.

        Trial court erred in determining assessor had discretion to calculate revenue from TIF by removing property for which TIF was suspended from the total assessed value but including the suspended property in the base value.
       </b>
       Assessor's calculation frustrates the legislative intent of the statute because it fails to give effect to the statutory requirement in subsection (9)(a)(II) that the portion of property tax in excess of the base amount be allocated to the authority. A calculation that creates an imbalance in an authority's TIF by including property in the base value while removing the same property from the new assessed value impedes the goals of addressing and financing renewal of blighted areas.

        Trial court correctly concluded that the twenty-five year period specified in subsection (9)(a) did not increase the TIF provision in the renewal plan for those properties added after the effective date of the plan.
       </b>
       Assessor and board of county commissioners correctly argue that the plain language of the statute and the renewal plan requires that the TIF period for all properties terminate in 2017, a date twenty-five years from the effective date of the original TIF provision, or 1992. Because the TIF provision was adopted in 1992 and no new TIF provision was adopted in 2004 or 2008 when new property was added to the urban renewal area, the twenty-five year period for the added property began in 1992.

       </b>
       The arbitration process is a county's exclusive remedy only with respect to challenges related to subsections (3.5)(a)(III), (IV), and (4)(b). Because the county assessor's interpretation of subsection (9)(a) is unrelated to compliance with subsections (3.5)(a)(III), (IV), and (4)(b), county's failure to arbitrate TIF issue does not bar assessor's defense to claims city asserted against him.

        Assessor's defense to city's claims is not barred by issue preclusion, collateral estoppel, or equitable estoppel.
       </b>
       First, the assessor's claim is not precluded by issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) because the meaning of the statute and the question of whether the city had the power to delay the start of the TIF clock was not decided during public hearings. Nor is the assessor's defense barred by claim preclusion (res judicata) because he was not party to or in privity with a party to the public hearings in which the plans were approved. Finally the assessor's defense is not barred by equitable estoppel because the city could not have reasonably relied on the assessor's or the county's inaction in a public hearing where the law grants them no role. Neither the assessor nor the county played any role in the public approval process. City of Aurora v. Scott,

        The twenty-five year period begins when the TIF provision is adopted.
       </b>
       A TIF provision is adopted on the date the plan or modification containing such a provision was approved. By tying the TIF period to the TIF provisions rather than the plan, the legislature has allowed for TIF provisions to run from the date a provision was approved, even if it was added to a plan later. Where there is no subsequent modification of the plan or a modification does not include a new TIF provision, the TIF provision is "adopted" when the original plan was approved. City of Aurora v.

        Subsection (9)(a)(I) sets the date for the base valuation and subsection (9)(a)(II) requires taxes in excess of the base valuation to be allocated to the urban renewal fund.
       </b>
       When read together these provisions require that TIF allocations begin on the effective date of approval of the urban renewal plan or modification containing the TIF provision. The common understanding of the phrase "effective date of adoption of such a provision" in subsection (9)(a) is the date on which a provision becomes enforceable or operational through a municipality's act of formally sanctioning or agreeing to the provision. To permit a city to define the "effective date of adoption of a [TIF] provision" would effectively allow the city to circumvent the statutory time limit. Allowing a city to define the "effective date of adoption" as any convenient date, regardless of when the provision was actually approved, would divorce the TIF timeline from the date of adoption and create a TIF limit of twenty-five years from any date chosen by the municipality. The statutory language does not support such a result. City of Aurora v. Scott,

        Adopting an urban renewal plan is not a legislative act.
       </b>
       Even if approving an urban renewal plan could be characterized as legislative, approving these plans would be beyond the city's powers because the plans conflict with the URL's TIF timeline. The public approval process includes notice and an opportunity to be heard for interested individuals, involves the application of existing standards to factors developed at a hearing, and affects specific individuals (as opposed to being generally applicable public policy). These are all factors that suggest a quasi-judicial decision. Moreover, even if approving an urban renewal plan could be characterized as legislative, approving these plans would be beyond the city's powers because the plan conflicts with the URL's TIF timeline. If a local ordinance conflicts with a state law in a matter of mixed state and local concern, the ordinance is superseded by state statute. The city plans' TIF provisions conflict with URL time limits. Therefore, even if the city's acts were legislative, they would nevertheless be invalid. City of Aurora v. Scott,

In the ordinance submitting the question of the acquisition of such lands or interests in land, the governing body shall state the location of the land or interests in land proposed to be acquired, describing the same by legal subdivisions, wherever practicable, and the consideration to be given for purchase and the manner of payment, and, in the ordinance submitting the question of incurring indebtedness, the governing body shall state the maximum net effective interest rate at which the bonds may be issued.

The bonds shall be signed by the mayor, countersigned by the auditor, treasurer, or finance director, and attested by the clerk and have the seal of the city with the approval of the president of the park commission, if such commission exists, endorsed thereon.

"Net interest cost" of a proposed issue of bonds means the total amount of interest to accrue on said bonds from their date of issuance to their respective maturities plus the amount of any discount below par or less the amount of any premium above par at which said bonds are being or have been sold. In all cases the net effective interest rate and net interest cost shall be computed without regard to any option of redemption prior to the designated maturity dates of the bonds.

       "Intersecting street" means any street which meets or crosses a pedestrian mall at a mall intersection but includes only those portions thereof on either side of a mall intersection which lie between the mall intersection and the first intersection of the intersecting street with a municipal street or highway open to vehicular traffic. If any portion of a pedestrian mall terminates on a street at a place thereon other than a place of intersection with a municipal street or state highway open to vehicular traffic, "intersecting street" also includes that portion of any street which lies between such place of termination and the first intersection of such street with a municipal street or state highway open to vehicular traffic. "Intersecting street" also includes any other street or portion thereof which the governing body, in a measure duly adopted as provided in this part 4, declares to be such.

       Any person owning, or having any legal or equitable interest in, any real property which might suffer legal damage by reason of the establishment of the proposed pedestrian mall shall file, prior to the first reading of the ordinance establishing the pedestrian mall, a written claim for damages with the clerk. Such written claim shall describe the real property as to which the claim is made, shall state the exact nature of the claimant's interest therein, shall state the exact nature of and grounds for the claimed damage thereto, and shall state the amount of damages claimed. The failure to file such written claim within the time provided in this subsection (1) is a waiver of any claim for damages or compensation and shall operate as a complete bar to any subsequent action seeking to prevent the establishment of said pedestrian mall or to recover damages on account of such establishment, and, in the event a claim is filed, such filing shall operate as a complete bar in any subsequent action for the recovery of any damages or compensation in excess of the amount stated in such claim. Any such claim may be withdrawn by the claimant at any time by written withdrawal with the same effect as if it had never been filed. The governing body shall receipt for the claims that have been filed in accordance with this section for damages or compensation from the establishment of the proposed mall.
      </li>
      <li id="t31-powersandfunctionsofcitiesandtowns-ar25-p04-s31-25-406ol12">
       The governing body may allow any claim for damages made pursuant to this section. Any claim so allowed shall be for the full amount of damages claimed in the written claim; except that the governing body, with the written consent of the claimant, may allow a claim for a lesser amount. In the event the claim is not allowed in full, or a suitable lesser amount is not agreed upon between the claimant and the governing body, or the governing body refuses to recognize the claim, the claimant or the governing body, through its legal counsel, may institute proceedings in court to ascertain the amount, if any, due the claimant; however, in no event shall an action be instituted later than two years after the date the claim has been denied. Any amount determined to be due to the claimant shall accrue interest at six percent per annum from the date that vehicular traffic is prohibited, in whole or in part, on the pedestrian mall, which closing in fact is the act from which the claimed damages arise.

      <li id="t31-powersandfunctionsofcitiesandtowns-ar25-p04-s31-25-406ol13">
       Before vehicular traffic is prohibited, in whole or in part, on the pedestrian mall, the governing body or another agency to which it is intended the mall will be conveyed shall pay the amounts allowed or enter into agreements with good and sufficient surety to pay the principal amounts allowed or, in the event the claim is to be litigated, an amount which the court determines is sufficient to pay the compensation in that behalf when ascertained. The required surety bond may be waived in writing by the claimant.

       Those lawsuits instituted to determine the amount of damages, if any, to be allowed shall be in the nature of a proceeding in eminent domain for the condemnation of the right in real property, the taking of which by the establishment of the pedestrian mall results in the damages claimed. The complaint shall in no way be construed as an admission that the rights in fact exist or that damages or compensation are due therefor. The court shall first determine the nature of the right in real property, if any, being taken. Such proceedings shall then be governed under the applicable statutes and proceedings of articles 1 to 7 of title 38, C.R.S., except as otherwise provided by this part 4.

       Nothing in this part 4 shall be construed or interpreted as creating any new right in any person to damages or compensation by reason of the establishment of a pedestrian mall, it being the intention of the general assembly in enacting this part 4 to provide an orderly method for the determination and payment only of such damages and compensation as are required under the constitutions of the state of Colorado and the United States. In this connection, the general assembly expressly declares that, to the extent to which the establishment of a pedestrian mall is justifiable as an exercise of the police power for which no compensation is constitutionally required, no damages or compensation shall be allowed in any action.
      </li>
      <li id="t31-powersandfunctionsofcitiesandtowns-ar25-p04-s31-25-406ol16">
       The general assembly expressly declares that the establishment of a pedestrian mall and the prohibition of vehicular traffic, in whole or in part, is a legislative act and within the discretion of the governing body except to the extent which may otherwise be provided in this part 4.

       In the event the governing body vacates the pedestrian mall or any part thereof by official act and such pedestrian mall or part thereof is not designated by the governing body to revert to a public street, the real property thereby vacated shall vest in abutting landowners in the same manner as if a public street were being vacated.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the governing body declares the same necessary for sanitary reasons, it may order the construction of district sanitary sewers in districts to be prescribed by ordinance so as to connect with any public or district sewer or with some natural drainage or disposal plant. Such districts, by like authority, may be divided into subdistricts or enlarged, diminished, or otherwise altered by ordinance at any time in accordance with the provisions of this part 5. The contract for district sewers may include all necessary manholes, inlets, and appurtenances and such mains of such reasonable extent outside the district as may be necessary to connect the district with a public sewer or some natural drainage or disposal plant. Contiguous municipalities may unite in the construction of a common sewer or cooperate in such construction or extend to each other the right to use any sewer constructed or to be constructed when such use may be deemed necessary for the discharge of the sewage of either, and such cooperation, common construction, or use shall be upon such terms as regards the apportionment of cost as may be agreed upon between the governing bodies of such contiguous municipalities.

       Building lots abutting a sanitary sewer system are prima facie presumed to be benefited as the result of its construction. The rule of apportionment according to area is, therefore, prima facie valid, but where any general method employed, though, prima facie, legal, would work an injustice, relief in proper circumstances may be granted.

      Upon completion of any local improvement or upon completion from time to time of any part thereof and upon acceptance thereof by the governing body or when the total cost of any improvement or of any such part thereof can be reasonably ascertained, either prior to, during, or subsequent to the construction of the improvements, the governing body shall cause to be prepared a statement showing the whole cost of the improvement, including costs of inspection and collection, capitalized interest on any bonds for such period as the governing body may deem necessary, capitalized bond reserves, and all other incidental costs, the portion thereof, if any, to be paid by the municipality, and the portion thereof to be assessed upon each lot or tract of land to be assessed for the same, which statement shall be filed in the office of the clerk. If the governing body determines that the basis of assessment is inequitable in any case, a just and equitable assessment shall be made upon the basis of benefits accruing to the property assessed by reason of the improvements made.

        Effect of omission of property that should have been assessed.
       </b>
       The omission of property which should have been assessed to pay the cost of a public improvement does not render the assessment or the proceedings void. All that could be claimed in such circumstances would be, that the assessment on property taxed for such improvement should be reduced to the extent it would have been had the omitted property been charged with its proportionate share of the expense.

        Burden of proof.

        To overcome prima facie evidence.
       </b>
       The passage of an ordinance of assessment for such improvements shall be prima facie evidence of the fact that the property assessed for such improvements is benefited and that such assessments have been lawfully levied. The burden is upon the plaintiff under said statute to overcome this presumption. Heron v. City of Englewood, 155

       Where the body having authority to correct errors and inequalities in the assessment renounces such authority and refuses to hear testimony, the proceeding cannot be regarded as a hearing, and the assessment is void.

       At any sale by the county treasurer of any property for the purpose of paying any special assessment for local improvements made under the provisions of this part 5, the municipal treasurer, having written authority from the governing body, may purchase any such property without paying for the same in cash and shall receive certificates of purchase therefor in the name of the municipality. The certificates shall be received and credited at their face value, with all interest and penalties accrued, on account of the assessments in pursuance of which the sale was made. The certificates may thereafter be sold by the municipal treasurer at their face value, with all interest and penalties accrued, and assigned by him to the purchaser in the name of the municipality. The proceeds of such sale shall be credited to the fund created by ordinance for the payment of such assessments respectively. In the event that all bonded indebtedness incurred in payment for said local improvements has been discharged in full, said certificates may be sold by the governing body for the best price obtainable at public sale, at auction, or by sealed bids in the same manner and under the same conditions as is provided in subsection (3) of this section. The proceeds shall be credited to the general fund of said municipality or to the special surplus and deficiency fund provided for by section  31-25-534 (2), as the circumstances may require.

Such sales shall be after public notice by the municipal treasurer or clerk to all persons having or claiming any interest in the property to be sold or in the proceeds of such sale by publication of such notice three times, a week apart, in a weekly or daily newspaper of general circulation within the county in which the property is located. Such notice shall describe the property and state the time, place, and manner of receiving bids; except that the time fixed for the sale shall not be less than ten days after the last publication. The municipality may reject any and all bids. Any interested party, at any time within ten days after the receipt of bids for the sale of property, may file with the municipality a written protest as to the sufficiency of the amount of any bid made or the validity of the proceedings for the sale. If the protest is denied, such person, within ten days thereafter, shall commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the municipality from completing the sale. If no such action is commenced, all protests or objections to the sale shall be waived and the municipality shall then convey the property to the successful bidder by quitclaim deed.

Any number of certificates may be foreclosed in the same proceeding.

       For the purpose of paying all or such portion of the cost of any improvement constructed under this part 5 as may be assessed against the property specially benefited, special assessment bonds of the municipality may be issued of such date, in such form, and on such terms, including, without limitation, provisions for their sale, payment, and redemption, as may be prescribed by the governing body, bearing the name of the street, alley, or district improved and payable in a sufficient period of years after such date to cover the period of payment provided and in convenient denominations. All such bonds shall be issued upon estimates approved by the governing body, and the municipal treasurer shall preserve a record of the same in a suitable book kept for that purpose. All such bonds shall be subscribed by the mayor, countersigned by the municipal treasurer, with the corporate seal thereto affixed, and attested by the clerk. Such bonds shall be payable out of the moneys collected on account of the assessments made for said improvements, from reserve accounts, if any, established to secure payment of such bonds, and from any other legally available moneys. Whenever three-fourths of the bonds for an improvement constructed under this part 5 have been paid and cancelled and for any reason any remaining assessments are not paid in time to pay the remaining bonds for the district and the interest due thereon, the municipality may pay, from legally available moneys, the bonds when due and the interest due thereon and reimburse itself by collecting the unpaid assessments due the district. All moneys collected from such assessments for any improvement shall be applied to the payment of the bonds issued until payment in full is made of all the bonds, both principal and interest, or to fund or replenish reserve accounts, if any, established to secure the payment of such bonds. The bonds may be used in payment of the cost of the improvement as specified; or the governing body, upon advertisement published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in such municipality and in such other newspapers as may be designated by the governing body, may sell a sufficient number of said bonds to pay such cost in cash for the best bid submitted in accordance with the terms of the notice of sale. All bids may be rejected at the discretion of the governing body. In addition, the bonds may be sold on such terms and conditions at a private sale if determined by the governing body to be in the best interests of the municipality.

     <p>
      When any improvement authorized by this part 5 is petitioned for by the owners of property to be assessed for more than one-half of the entire costs estimated by the governing body to be assessed, it is the duty of the municipal officials whose duty it is to act to authorize said improvement, and an order in the nature of mandamus may issue out of any court of competent jurisdiction requiring said officials to take such action as is required by this part 5; but, if the material petitioned for is known to be worthless or of poor quality or would not make a good, substantial, and reasonable permanent improvement, the governing body may refuse to grant a petition for that reason. If a material petitioned for or designated in the specifications is a patented or proprietary article on which there can be but one bid, the governing body may refuse to award a contract if the entire bid is excessive as compared with improvements of equal value or may reject the bid or readvertise.

        Time limitations for attacking assessments.
       </b>
       Reasonable limitations regarding the time within which actions can be commenced attacking the validity of special assessments for public improvements are necessary. To meet the expenses of such improvements bonds must be negotiated, and unless there is some reasonable limit within which actions may be commenced to attack assessments levied for the purpose of liquidating such bonds when they mature, they could not be disposed of advantageously because parties purchasing would never know when an action might be commenced by some dissatisfied taxpayer; and on the other hand, after the lapse of the statutory period they would have the right to presume no such actions could be maintained, and their rights ought to be protected by a statute which fixes a time within which suits must be commenced, unless it is apparent that thereby some constitutional right of the taxpayer has been denied or invaded.

      The governing body, from time to time as work proceeds in a local improvement district, may authorize the issuance of interim warrants: For not to exceed ninety percent in value of the work theretofore done upon estimates of the engineer of the municipality; after completion of the work and acceptance thereof by the engineer of the municipality and by the governing body, for one hundred percent of the value of the work so completed; and, where improvements in the district require the acquisition of property, for an amount not exceeding the value of the property. The warrants may be issued to a contractor to apply at par value on the contract price for the improvements or to the owner of the property to apply at par value on the property price. The warrants may also be issued and sold at not less than par value in such manner as the governing body may determine, and the proceeds may be used to apply towards payment of the contract price and property price. Interim warrants shall bear interest from date of issue until paid at such rate as may be fixed by the governing body. Interest accruing on interim warrants shall be included as a cost of the improvements in the local improvement district. Interim warrants and interest thereon shall be paid by the issuance of or by proceeds from the sale of special improvement bonds issued or in cash received from the payment of assessments not pledged to the payment of the bonds or from any of such sources.

       To carry out the purposes of this part 6, the board is hereby authorized pursuant to a duly adopted ordinance to issue bonds of the district. Such bonds shall bear interest at a rate such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds does not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate authorized, payable at such times as determined by the board, and shall be due and payable in installments at such times as determined by the board extending not more than twenty years from date of issuance. The form and terms of said bonds, including provisions for their sale, payment, and redemption, shall be determined by the board. To the extent required by section 20 of article X of the Colorado constitution, such bonds shall not be issued unless first approved at an election held for that purpose in accordance with articles 1 to 13 of title 1, C.R.S., or article 10 of this title. If the board so determines, such bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity, with or without payment of a premium, but no premium shall exceed three percent of the principal thereof. The bonds shall be executed in the name of and on behalf of the district and signed by the presiding officer of the board with the seal of the district affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the board. Such bonds shall be in such denominations as the board shall determine. Interest coupons, if any, shall bear the original or facsimile signature of the presiding officer of the board. Under no circumstances shall any of said bonds be held to be an indebtedness, obligation, or liability of the municipalities or counties in which the district is located, and bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this part 6 shall contain a statement to that effect.

      With respect to property concerning which there is no appearance or concerning which all objections presented are overruled, the court shall forthwith enter a final order fixing the amount of the delinquency and costs and directing the treasurer of the taxing authority to sell such property at a date not more than ten days after the entry of such order for the purpose of satisfying the same. No proceeding to review any order of the district court entered under the provisions of this part 11 for the sale of any property shall be commenced after thirty days from the entry of the order sought to be reviewed. No proceeding to review such order shall be permitted to interrupt or delay the sale of any property with respect to which no such proceeding has been commenced. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any person in interest who has not been given actual notice. No sale shall be stayed unless the applicant for review files a bond in the supreme court in a penal sum not less than the amount of the delinquent assessment, with the condition that the amount of said tax, together with costs, shall be summarily forfeited to the taxing authority if the ruling of the trial court is sustained, in which event payment under the bond shall constitute a payment of the delinquent tax. If order of sale is denied by the district court, the taxing authorities shall have the right to a review of the proceedings in the supreme court and shall not be required to file a bond therefor.

      The retirement pension of a volunteer firefighter who has earned twenty years of active service as a volunteer firefighter for any one municipality or district shall be paid from the fund of that municipality or district, and no other fund shall pay a pension to that volunteer firefighter. The retirement pension of a volunteer firefighter who earns twenty years of active service as a volunteer firefighter after June 2, 1977, by serving more than one municipality or district shall be paid from the fund of each municipality or district for which the volunteer firefighter served at least five years. The amount paid by each fund for each year of service with the particular municipality or district shall equal one-twentieth of the retirement pension being paid by that fund on the day the volunteer firefighter left the service of the particular municipality or district. The retirement pension of a volunteer firefighter who earns twenty years of active service as a volunteer firefighter by serving more than one municipality or district shall be paid only by the municipality or district last served by that volunteer firefighter if any part of the twenty years of service was earned on or before June 2, 1977. In no event shall a volunteer firefighter receive a total retirement benefit from all volunteer firefighter pension funds exceeding the maximum amount paid by the board from such funds pursuant to section

      The general assembly finds and declares that the establishment of statewide actuarial standards regarding funded and unfunded liabilities of state-assisted old hire police officers' and firefighters' pension funds established pursuant to this article is a matter of statewide concern affected with a public interest, and the provisions of this part 3 are enacted in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of this state. The general assembly further declares that state moneys provided to municipalities, fire protection districts, and county improvement districts do not constitute an obligation of the state to participate in the costs of pension plan benefits but are provided in recognition that said local governments are currently burdened with financial obligations relating to pensions in excess of their present financial capacities. It is the intent of the general assembly in providing state moneys to assist said local governments that state participation decrease annually, terminating at the earliest possible date.

      In municipalities, fire protection districts, and county improvement districts having a population of less than one hundred thousand, any old hire member who has reached the age of fifty years and who has served for a period of twenty years of active service in any such department in this state is entitled to a monthly pension equal to one-half the amount of the member's monthly salary as of the date of the member's retirement plus, if the governing body of the municipality, the board of directors of the fire protection district, or the board of the county improvement district authorizes such additional benefits, one-half of any increase in salary and longevity or additional pay based on length of service granted during the period of the member's retirement to the rank occupied by the member in said department. Any old hire member of a paid fire department of a municipality, fire protection district, or county improvement district, who has served prior time in a volunteer fire department in any municipality, fire protection district, or county improvement district in this state, in the event the member becomes a paid member, may be credited service time at their discretion, at the rate of one year of paid service for each four complete years of volunteer time; except that they shall not receive both a pension under part 11 of article 30 of this title and a service credit under this section.

       If an old hire member of any police department in a municipality having a population of less than one hundred thousand, while in the performance of the member's duty or by reason of service in such department, becomes physically or mentally disabled and such disability is deemed to be of a temporary nature, the board of trustees shall retire the individual with a disability and shall authorize the payment to such individual, monthly, of an amount from the pension fund equal to the monthly compensation paid any such member as salary at the date of such disability, not to exceed a period of one year. For the purpose of determining the physical or mental disability of any such member, the board of trustees may personally examine the member or may appoint one or more physicians or surgeons to make an examination of the member and report their findings to the board, which report may be taken into consideration in determining whether the member has a physical or mental disability.

Such retired member is entitled to notice and to be present at the hearing of any such evidence and may be represented by counsel. The retired member shall be permitted to propound any question pertinent or relevant to such matter and shall also have the right to introduce evidence on the member's own behalf. All witnesses so produced shall be examined under oath, and any member of such board of trustees is authorized to administer such oath to such witnesses. The decision of such board shall be final.

       If any old hire member or officer of any police department in a municipality having a population of less than one hundred thousand becomes mentally or physically disabled so as to render necessary the member's retirement from service in such department, said board of trustees shall retire such member from service in such department, and the member shall receive from the pension fund an amount equal to one-half of the monthly salary received by the member at the time the member becomes so disabled. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, when any old hire member of such police department or retired old hire member dies and leaves a surviving spouse or dependent parent or children under the age of sixteen years, surviving, the board of trustees shall authorize the payment monthly from the pension fund of the sum of thirty dollars to such surviving spouse or dependent parent and six dollars to each such minor child until the child reaches the age of sixteen years. No pension shall be paid to the dependent parent of the deceased member who leaves a surviving spouse, and, if the surviving spouse of any deceased member remarries, such pension shall cease.

No such member who has completed twenty years of active duty before the date of such retirement shall be reexamined. No member on the retired list shall be examined sooner than one year after date of retirement and not more often than once a year thereafter. In the event it is found by said board that any member on the retired list has recovered from the disability that caused the member's retirement, such member, if the member is under fifty years of age and has served less than twenty years of active duty, shall be removed from the retired list and ordered to report to the chief officer of said fire department within thirty days for assignment to active duty. During said period of thirty days, such member may file a written protest in which the member shall state any objection to the member's removal from the retired list. The decision of said board shall be suspended pending a hearing on said protest, at which hearing such member shall have the right to appear and to be represented by counsel. During the period that any member is retired for disability by said board, such member, if under the age of fifty years and having served less than twenty years of active duty, shall be carried on a special roll of the fire department and listed as inactive.

Such program and any amendments thereto must be approved in an election held or vote called for that purpose by at least sixty-five percent of the total votes cast by all police officers or firefighters actively employed by the municipality, fire protection district, or county improvement district and all former old hire members who have earned pension rights or benefits under this article at the time the program is adopted or amended.

Any municipality, fire protection district, or county improvement district having established an exempt alternative program pursuant to this section shall be entitled to receive its appropriate share of state contributions to local police officers' or firefighters' pension funds and shall file any reports required to receive such state contributions. The date limitation of January 1, 1980, established in this subsection (1) shall not be construed as limiting the ability of an employer to establish an exempt money purchase plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section and section  31-30.5-802.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby declares that the establishment of police officers' and firefighters' pension plans in this state is a matter of statewide concern that affects the public safety and general welfare, that the ability of pension funds to pay earned benefits to present and future members is a necessary corollary to the establishment of pension plans, and that statewide pension plans establishing pension benefits that can be fully funded with local moneys will permit the continuation of pension plans for police officers and firefighters in this state. In addition, the general assembly declares that any pension plan must be actuarially sound in order to assure the security of the pension system and that this article is enacted to provide for the stability and security of police officers' and firefighters' pension plans in this state. The general assembly further declares that state moneys provided to municipalities, fire protection districts, and county improvement districts do not constitute a continuing obligation of the state to participate in the ongoing normal costs of pension plan benefits, except for state funding of death and disability benefits as specified in this article, but are provided in recognition that the local governments are currently burdened with financial obligations relating to pensions in excess of their present financial capacities. It is the intent of the general assembly in providing state moneys to assist the local governments that state participation decrease annually, terminating at the earliest possible date.

       The payment of state plan benefits in addition to those provided by the Denver city charter would disserve the basic purpose of the legislation which is to relieve communities of the intolerable financial burdens they would otherwise face in connection with their pension plans.

The annual normal retirement pension shall be two percent of the average of the member's highest three years' base salary multiplied by the member's years of service, not to exceed twenty-five.

         The board shall determine after each annual actuarial valuation if the cost of all benefits established by this part 4 for members covered under this section and the cost of a normal retirement pension beginning at age fifty-five for members then eligible may be fully funded on an actuarially sound basis without necessitating an increase in the eight percent employer and eight percent member contributions made pursuant to section  31-31-402 or such higher member contribution rate established pursuant to section  31-31-408 (1.5)(a). If the board cannot so determine, it shall order that the normal retirement pension commence such number of months as are actuarially supportable, from one to sixty, after age fifty-five for members who have completed at least twenty-five years of active service and are otherwise eligible in accordance with the board's determination. The determination of the board shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. A pension commenced after age fifty-five pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall not be subject to annual review. If a court determines that this paragraph (b) is invalid, the age of retirement to be eligible for any normal retirement benefit shall be age sixty except for persons receiving a benefit at the time of the court's decision.

When the inactive member attains age fifty-five, the member shall be eligible to receive an annual vested benefit equal to two percent of the member's average highest three years' salary multiplied by years, not to exceed twenty-five, of active service. Any such member shall be eligible to receive the applicable vested benefit as provided in this section or to make an election for a reduced pension in the manner provided in section  31-31-403 (5). All the provisions of section  31-31-403 (5) shall apply to the member; except that the benefits used to calculate the reduced benefits shall be the vested benefit provided to the member under this section rather than the retirement benefit provided in section 31-31-403.

Such assessment, when completed, shall be subject to inspection by any interested person. Notice of the making and completion of the assessment shall be given by the publication of a notice to the effect that said assessment has been made upon said lots and is ready for inspection. The notice shall be published at least once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper published or of general circulation in said city or town and shall designate a day upon which the governing body shall sit for the purpose of hearing objections thereto and making corrections therein. Upon the day designated, the governing body shall sit for said purpose and hear any objections that may be made and shall thereupon make any such changes in said assessments as may in their judgment be necessary, equitable, or just and shall thereupon finally determine such assessments. Such assessments, when so finally determined, shall be a lien upon the property so assessed for the purpose of making said improvement. An appeal shall lie to any court of competent jurisdiction from any decision of such governing body.
