         Only statutory fees collected.
        </b>
        Since the compensation of any public official for services rendered in his official capacity is regulated by statute, he is entitled only to demand and receive fees for those services concerning which compensation by law attaches, because it is an inflexible rule that an official can demand only such fees or compensation as the law has definitely fixed and authorized for the performance of his official duties.

         Fees enter fund from which treasurer is compensated.
        </b>
        The fees and commissions are to be collected by the treasurer, not as his compensation for the particular work for which the fee may be prescribed, but for the purpose of creating a fund out of which his salary or compensation is to be paid. The annual salary is what the treasurer gets for all the work that he does, it is compensation for his services. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Otero Irrigation Dist., 56

         The word "collect"

        is used to define the power of the county treasurers to gather in or receive money for taxes theretofore assessed, and since the fees provided for in this section are charged upon "all moneys received" by the treasurer, they fall within the above definition and are fees charged for the collection of taxes and are therefore collection fees.

         The county clerk's compensation for official acts is regulated by this section,

        The sum allowed by law per diem to the county clerk for his services as clerk of the board of commissioners is a fee within the meaning of the salary act, and it is payable to him absolutely, and the board is without authority to annex to its payment any condition whatever.

        A county clerk, in his capacity as clerk of the board of county commissioners, is required to perform all services clerical in their nature, in connection with matters within the scope of the authority of the board, which are necessary to enable it to perform its duties with respect to such matters, and he is not entitled to fees for such services outside of his compensation as clerk of the board.

        This section expressly charges the county commissioners with the duty of auditing the accounts of county officers, and correcting and adjusting the same. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Davis, 27 Colo. App. 501, 150 P. 324 (1915).

         The board had no control of the public examiner,

        no authority to direct an audit by him of the books of a county officer, and was not charged with notice of his report when made. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Davis, 27 Colo. App. 501, 150 P. 324 (1915).

         The purpose and vital importance of an efficient audit were manifest
        </b>
        from the statutory requirement that all prescribed fees had to be collected in advance by county officers, and when collected had to be paid to the county treasurer, and that any balance left to the credit of the several funds in any year after the salaries and compensation provided for had been paid therefrom, would be placed to the credit of the general county fund.

         Penalty stimulates collection.
        </b>
        The fact is recognized that sometimes such prior ascertainment may be impossible, and therefore the fees may not be so collected, and in order to stimulate or coerce the collection of the fees earned and belonging to the county, to wit, the excess above the sums necessary to make up the officer's salary, the penalty of charging the uncollected portion thereof against his salary is provided.

         Negligent or wilful failure results in forfeiture.

        This section makes it the duty of the clerk to collect every fee for services performed by him, and provides a forfeiture if he shall wilfully or negligently fail to do so. Henderson v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 4 Colo. App. 301, 35 P. 880 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        This penalty is not to be enforced unless the failure to make such collection is due to the negligence or wilfulness of the delinquent official. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43

        As to uncollected fees, a county judge was only liable for the negligent or wilful failure to collect. Price v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 22 Colo. App. 315, 124 P. 353 (1912).
       </p>

        <b>
         In a literal sense, the uncollected fees cannot be charged against the officer's salary,

         Negligent or wilful failure must be alleged.
        </b>
        Under this section a complaint against a county judge for surplus fees uncollected had to allege that his failure to collect the same was negligent or wilful. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43

         Burden of proof.
        </b>
        In a suit against a county judge to recover the surplus uncollected fees of his office, the burden of proof was on the county commissioners to show that the fees were negligently or wilfully left uncollected. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43

        , 95 P. 289 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Slight evidence was sufficient to shift the burden of proof on the officer to establish the exercise of reasonable diligence in endeavoring to collect such unpaid fees. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43

       The actual traveling expenses of the sheriff provided for in this section are to be paid out of and not exceeding a mileage fee at the statutory rate per mile actually and necessarily traveled in the performance of his duty, which fee is separate and distinct from and in addition to that prescribed in the fee act.

       <b>
        The allowance for traveling expenses is not a payment for services, but it is a reimbursement
       </b>
       of money expended, and is in addition to, and independent of, salary, and if the traveling expenses should exceed the amount of mileage, at the rate limited, against which they are chargeable, the full expenses could not be paid, and a proportionate loss would be suffered; but when mileage in either a civil or criminal case has been collected and deposited, it is the duty of the board of commissioners to allow the traveling expenses incurred in the case, payable out of the mileage, if it amounts to so much, or if not, to the extent of the mileage deposited. Bransom v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 5 Colo. App. 231, 37 P. 957 (1894).

        If a sheriff travels upon a railroad on a free pass, he cannot be allowed the ordinary railroad fare as expenses necessarily incurred,

        But, the liability of the county in such cases depended in part upon the facts and circumstances of each case,

       of litigants if in civil cases, and the various statutory conditions that made the county liable for costs in criminal cases had to have happened before the sheriff got credit from the county therefor; so that, in compensating the sheriff, he was not only limited to his salary and actual traveling expenses, but to get these he had to first have collected from the parties to suits the various items of fees which went to make up, and out of which only, his compensation was paid.

        The general assembly recognizes that in the establishment of the state of Colorado the counties of the territory of Colorado were adopted as the counties of the new state and that there have been additional counties established by law and in accordance with then current methods of surveying and describing county boundaries. The general assembly finds and declares that it is desirable to revise the descriptions of county boundaries to update and establish by law more precise definitions of the boundaries of the several counties of this state as they are known to exist with the use of modern methods and equipment. It is not the intent of the general assembly to effect the transfer of land from one county to another or to adversely affect the title of any property merely because of the redefinition of county boundaries.

        When the Arkansas river channel was altered in 1935-36 it was not a slow and gradual change but a sudden change caused by mechanical or artificial means so as to constitute an avulsion rather than an accretion, and when such a sudden change occurs, there is no alteration in the boundary line; it remains at the location of the river immediately prior to the change.

        and the line thus stated in a description is to be taken as run due south unless there is some other thing in the description which compels or permits another course in order to work out the description which the grantor has put in a deed or whereby a general assembly has fixed the boundaries of a county.

         Therefore, the description in the location of Jefferson county "thence south to the Platte river"

        starts and runs a line from the junction of North and South Clear creeks due south to the Platte river. Link v. Jones, 15 Colo. App. 281, 62 P. 339 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the general assembly stated the western boundary of Jefferson county and ran the line south from the junction of North and South Clear creeks it ran a line due south making allowance for the magnetic variation, and it must strike the Platte river at the point where that line thus projected would strike the stream.

     <p>
      When a majority of the taxpaying electors residing in that portion of the territory of any county proposed to be stricken off and annexed to an adjoining county shall petition the board of county commissioners of the county in which such territory is situate to have such portion stricken off and annexed to the adjoining county, giving the area and general boundaries of such territory by natural objects and monuments as near as may be, and shall deposit with such board of county commissioners an amount of money sufficient to pay the expenses of the surveying and platting of such territory, it is the duty of the said commissioners to have such territory surveyed and platted in a suitable manner and to cause to be submitted to the registered electors of such county at the general election next after the filing of such petition and plat with them the question of whether such portion of the territory of their county shall be so stricken off. The board of county commissioners shall also require the county clerk and recorder, in giving the notice required by law of the general election then next ensuing, to insert therein a notice to said registered electors that the question of striking off such territory from their county, particularly describing such territory by metes and bounds as shown by said survey, will be submitted to them for their approval or rejection and that they should designate on their ballots their approval thereof, which shall be expressed by the words "for the new county line", or their dissent thereto, expressed by the words "against the new county line". The board of county commissioners of the county to which such territory has been annexed may, in their discretion, pay the necessary expenses of such survey and plat by warrant on the treasury as in other cases.

       Editor's note:
      </b>
      Subsection (10) of this section contained a provision that repealed the entire section effective August 5, 2003. Subsection (10) was deleted by amendment in House Bill 03-1239 to give continuing effect to the section. The bill also amended subsection (8) and added a new subsection (8.5). This bill did not contain a safety clause. A bill without a safety clause usually takes effect on the day following the expiration of the ninety-day period after adjournment of the general assembly. Therefore, House Bill 03-1239 would normally take effect on August 6, 2003, one day after the repeal of the section was to take effect. An argument could be made that the deletion of the repealer and the other amendments to the section were of no effect because the repeal had already taken effect on the previous day. However, such an interpretation would defeat the general assembly's purpose in enacting the bill. For that reason, if a court is asked to address this circumstance, it could reach the conclusion that the amendment deleting the repeal should be given effect as of the date the governor signed the bill on April 22, 2003, rather than the technical effective date (see People v. Tacorante, 624 P.2d 1324 (Colo. 1981), where a similar conclusion was reached). In view of these factors, the repeal of this section is not reflected in the version printed above; rather, the section appears as amended by House Bill 03-1239.

      When the boundary lines of any county in this state are so indefinite that a portion of territory, by reason of such indefinite description, is claimed by two counties, and such fact appears by petition of the board of county commissioners of either county to the state engineer, it is the duty of such state engineer, in connection with the county surveyor of each of such counties, to run out and establish such lines as nearly as may be in accordance with such defective description, fix and define such boundary line by monuments in accordance with rules issued by the state board of licensure for architects, professional engineers, and professional land surveyors, and to furnish the board of county commissioners of each of said counties with a description of such line as soon thereafter as may be practical, deposit such survey as a land survey plat in each county, and file a Colorado land survey monument record on each monument found or set, as specified in section

      . When such line is established it shall be the boundary line between said counties, unless one of said counties, within six months from the day of filing the description of said line by the state engineer with the board of county commissioners of such county, commences an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in this state to determine and settle such disputed line, and prosecute the same with due diligence until its final determination, or has settled such disputed line, within said six months, by arbitration. If the county surveyor of either of such counties shall not appear or assist the state engineer in making such survey after due notice so to do, it shall in no manner affect or invalidate such survey, or the boundary lines as they may be fixed by such state engineer.

        Under the constitution the general assembly has no power to remove a county seat.

        Regulated by general law.
       </b>
       The constitution deprives the general assembly of power to remove a county seat, but permits the question of such removal to be regulated by general law, with the limitations, that there can be no removal unless a majority of the electors vote for it, and that no proposition on the subject shall be submitted more often than once in four years. Coleman v. People, 7 Colo. App. 243, 42 P. 1041 (1895).

      <p>
       <b>
        Voting majorities required for placement or removal.
       </b>
       The plain meaning of this section is that where the county seat has not been permanently located a majority of all the legal votes upon the proposition must be in favor of some one place, and if it has been permanently established, it requires a two-thirds vote in favor of some one place before a removal can be effected.

        Where the relator, in mandamus proceedings to compel the removal of a county seat, has long been a resident of the county,
       </b>
       without taking steps to test the legality of its location, he should not be permitted to initiate such proceedings. Coleman v. People, 7 Colo. App. 243, 42 P. 1041 (1895).

     <p>
      The board of county commissioners has the power to make all needful arrangements for having such county seat surveyed into lots, squares, streets, and alleys, selling and disposing of the same, and erecting a jailhouse, courthouse, or other county buildings as to the board seems best.

       This section does not mean that judges and clerks of courts of record are prohibited from allowing persons other than parties in interest or their attorneys to examine the pleadings or other papers on file in such courts; however, it does mean that although there is no absolute right to examine such pleadings or other papers, persons could be allowed to do so at discretion of court.

        Mandamus proper remedy.

       Where a county clerk and recorder refuses to allow abstractors the use of the county records for the purpose of making abstracts, mandamus is a proper remedy for them to resort to. Stocknan v. Brooks, 17

       An allegation by plaintiffs, in their petition for mandamus, that the county clerk and recorder refused to allow them to examine the records, or make memoranda therefrom, though often requested to do so, is sufficient, since by the terms of this section any person has the right to inspect the records; and it is not necessary to allege that plaintiffs did not have all the information that could be acquired by the enforcement of the writ.

       The court said that the word "vacancy" as used in modern times relates not only to the office which is to be filled, but to the term for which the appointment is to be made. Monash v. Rhoades, 11 Colo. App. 404, 53 P. 236 (1898), aff'd, 27

        Conviction works disqualification and vacancy.

        Instant vacancy upon conviction.
       </b>
       The happening of the event fixes the time and fulfillment of the vacancy, and the mingling of situations which ordinarily would give rise to vacancies ipso facto with others that do not necessarily create vacancies ipso facto, without difference of treatment in the statute, is significant, thus, among the listed events creating a vacancy in office are three which by their very nature result in termination of office holding, and the statutory declaration that the office becomes vacant upon the happening thereof seems almost surplusage; also reference is made to the provisions relating to the death of an incumbent, or his resignation, or his removal; the occurrence of any of these events establishes instanter a vacancy; and to hold that the death of an incumbent, or his resignation, or his removal effects an immediate vacancy in the office but that the same is not true as to an officer convicted of either of the described offenses would result in a strained, unnatural and illogical construction, in view of the language employed in the statute which makes no such distinction.

        Effect of out-of-state convictions.
       </b>
       The fact that the general assembly has provided in certain statutes that convictions in other jurisdictions shall operate disadvantageously in the state to the convicted person, and did not so provide in this section, requires us to hold that, as to the latter, the general assembly purposely omitted words which would have given effect to foreign convictions, because to ascertain the intent of the general assembly enacting a particular statute, resort may be had to a comparison in language of the statute under study with analogous but unrelated legislation.

       The right of any public official to resign cannot be doubted; but when the resignation is predicated upon the premise, stated, or which his conduct may imply, that it is to avoid performing a specific duty in the interest of a party in whose behalf such official is legally bound to act, his resignation, however formally tendered and accepted, will be regarded as without effect.

        Intent of "by the county commissioners".
       </b>
       When the general assembly in 1963 amended this statute by adding the words "by the county commissioners", the supreme court believed to be obvious that it was the general assembly's intent to make it clear and unmistakable that the county commissioners henceforth had the duty and responsibility to maintain their commission districts as compact districts with populations as nearly equal as possible.

       and a provision for the recovery of such damages as the county shall sustain by reason of a breach of the conditions of the bond, and designating who might bring suit for such recovery, is certainly germane to the subject matter of such a title. Patterson v. Watson, 35

        Subsequent bond not authorized.

       When a person duly elected to the office of county commissioner has executed his bond as required by law, when said bond has been approved by the judge of the proper district, and when the person so elected and qualified has actually entered upon the duties of his office, the district court or judge, thereafter, has no jurisdiction to order said commissioner to give a new bond with further sureties to be approved by said court or judge, and, in default of compliance with such order, to declare such commissioner's office vacant.

       It is said that a public record is one required by law to be kept, or necessary to be kept, in the discharge of a duty imposed by law, or directed by law to serve as a memorial and evidence of something written, said, or done. Treat v. McDonough, 148

       Tract indices kept by the county clerk and recorder for the purpose of preparing abstracts of title, even though not within the terms of the statute, constitute an appropriate mode of discharging the clerk's duties, hence, it was not only his right but his duty to keep them and having done so they became public property subject to public use as provided by statute.

      When a vacancy occurs in the office of sheriff of any county, the undersheriff of such county shall in all things execute the office of sheriff until a sheriff is appointed or elected and qualified. Any default or misfeasance in office of such undersheriff in the meantime, as well as before such vacancy, shall be deemed to be a breach of the condition of the bond given by the sheriff who appointed the undersheriff or the insurance policy purchased by the county on the sheriff's behalf.

         Responsibility of sheriffs.

        Because this section makes sheriffs responsible for the official acts of their deputies and undersheriffs, it is consistent that it grants authority to the sheriffs to dismiss deputy sheriffs at their pleasure. Therefore, a sheriff cannot limit his power to terminate deputy sheriffs because that would forbid something the state expressly authorized. Seeley v.

       30-10-516. Sheriffs to preserve peace - command aid.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the duty of the sheriffs, undersheriffs, and deputies to keep and preserve the peace in their respective counties, and to quiet and suppress all affrays, riots, and unlawful assemblies and insurrections. For that purpose, and for the service of process in civil or criminal cases, and in apprehending or securing any person for felony or breach of the peace, they, and every coroner, may call to their aid such person of their county as they may deem necessary.

        County warrants are payable in the order of their presentation to the county treasurer, and not otherwise,
       </b>
       and the law enters into and becomes part of the contract between the county and the holders of its warrants, and each registered warrant matures as soon as sufficient money has accumulated in the treasury to the credit of the proper fund for its payment, after paying all other warrants of the same class whose registry was prior in time.

        Contractual obligation.
       </b>
       It is settled by authority that where the law, at the time of the issuance of a warrant, provides for its payment in the order of its presentation this becomes a part of the contract and cannot be altered or changed, at least without an equally safe, certain, and speedy provision for payment.

        Right to sue.
       </b>
       It was held that a county warrant payable out of any money in the treasury appropriated for county expenditures was a written acknowledgment of indebtedness by the county and if not paid, when presented, could be sued on by the legal holder, although there was no money in the treasury to pay.

        There is a well-recognized distinction between a deputy and an assistant;

       the former must be a qualified elector, take the oath of office and give bond to the assessor, whereas the latter need not be a qualified elector and is not required to take the oath of office or to give bond, because a deputy assessor performs duties requiring the exercise of discretion; not so an assistant.

       Since it was not through any neglect or default of the assessor that a county was not divided into districts which would have authorized him to appoint deputies instead of clerks, it would be inequitable to require the assessor to bear the expenses thus necessarily incurred; having paid the clerks, the assessor's right to reimbursement, although not covered by the express terms of this section, may be fairly implied therefrom, also the power of the commissioners to allow the claim.

       Where board of county commissioners, under its authority to manage the business of the county, entered into a contract with plaintiffs to fix valuations of land, which assessor admittedly was unable to determine, such contract is ultra vires and void, because the right to employ capable assistants comes within the purview of the duties primarily conferred on the assessor and cannot be claimed as an implied power of the board of county commissioners, because the board, as such, has no authority to impose itself upon the express powers of another county officer.

        The board of county commissioners was a proper party and entitled to recover damages against the building contractor and his surety
       </b>
       under third party beneficiary principles, because in Colorado one may enforce a contractual obligation made for his benefit although he was not a party to the agreement, when such an obligation is apparent from the agreement and the surrounding circumstances. The obligation for the benefit of the county is inherent in the contract documents and circumstances. Under the leasehold agreement, the public building authority's obligation to the county to construct the courthouse building was recognized, and the building plans and specifications were subject to the approval of the county. Under the construction agreement, the county has the right to approve the form of the performance bond. The contractor was not entitled to final payment until completion of the building and final acceptance of work by the authority, the county and the architects. The land belonged to the county and was leased to the authority to have the courthouse built and to lease the land and building back to the county. Thus, the agreements and the circumstances show that the benefit of faithful performance of the construction agreement and the bond were intended to flow to the county. Such contractual benefit to the property owner is enforceable by him. Cox v. Fremont County Pub. Bldg. Auth., 415 F.2d 882 (10th Cir. 1969).

The board shall not designate a pioneer trail across public lands on a road administered by the federal government unless the road is designated as open to travel by the appropriate federal land management agency. Except as set forth in subsection (2) of this section, the designation of the pioneer trail is effective upon the date of the resolution.

       If a county designates any portion of a state highway as a pioneer trail, the designation is not effective unless the general assembly, acting by joint resolution, also designates the portion of the state highway as part of the pioneer trail.

Oil and gas and other mineral rights or any of them thus reserved by a county upon the sale of such real estate may be sold by order of the board of county commissioners at public sale to the highest and best bidder after four weeks' prior notice by publication two times in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the land is situated, said notice to describe the oil and gas or other mineral rights to be sold, the location of the land involved, and the date, time, and place of such sale; but a copy of said notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, by the board of county commissioners to the owner of the surface at the time of such notice as shown by the records in the office of the county assessor of the county in which such lands are situated at the last known address of such owner as shown by said books of the county assessor, and that a copy of said notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, by the board of county commissioners to the person in possession of the surface.

Nothing contained in this section shall prevent a county from selling any number of such units or parcels at any public sale.

Any such lease of mineral rights, other than oil and gas, shall be for a term not to exceed twenty-five years and as long thereafter as such minerals are produced. Leases of any such mineral rights made or entered into by the board in conformity with the provisions of this section prior to February 25, 1955, are hereby confirmed, validated, and declared to be legal and valid insofar as the authority of any such board is concerned.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby declares that landfill gas constitutes a hazard to the health, welfare, and safety of the people of this state, whether such gas has accumulated as a result of a public or private landfill operation, and that the extraction of landfill gas will ameliorate this dangerous condition, and further declares that the development of landfill gas will provide a valuable, alternate energy resource to the citizens of this state. In order to diminish this hazard and utilize this energy resource, the powers of counties are hereby expanded to authorize landfill gas exploration, development, and production; the financing thereof; the marketing and sale of landfill gas to any public or private person or entity; and the county use thereof for any purpose.

       Upon being requested to do so by an agency of the United States, the governing body shall determine if any telecommunications research facility of the United States is located wholly or partially within its jurisdiction. If such determination results in a finding that such a facility is so located, the planning commission, the board of adjustment, and the governing body shall, from and after April 23, 1969, be bound by the following: When considering any request for rezoning, exceptions to or variances from the terms of zoning regulations, or changed or additional uses of land within a distance of two miles from the perimeter of any telecommunications research facility of the United States, the planning commission, the board of adjustment, and the governing body shall consider, in a like manner as those criteria set forth in sections  30-28-115 and  31-23-303, C.R.S., and other criteria applied to the consideration of requests for rezoning, exceptions to or variances from zoning regulations, or changed or additional uses of land, any data presented as to the effect that development made pursuant to such request will have on such telecommunications research facility of the United States, including what interference may be caused to said facility by the emanation of electrical impulses from electrical equipment that may be installed if such request is approved.

     This article was numbered as article 12 of chapter 36, C.R.S. 1963. The substantive provisions of this part 1 were repealed and reenacted in 1977, resulting in the addition, relocation, and elimination of sections as well as subject matter. For amendments to this part 1 prior to 1977, consult the Colorado statutory research explanatory note and the table itemizing the replacement volumes and supplements to the original volume of C.R.S. 1973 beginning on page vii in the front of this volume.

Title I of HFRA authorizes the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to expedite the development and implementation of hazardous fuel reduction projects on federal lands managed by the United States forest service and the bureau of land management when these agencies meet certain conditions. HFRA emphasizes the need for federal agencies to work collaboratively with local communities in developing hazardous fuel reduction projects, placing priority on treatment areas identified by the local communities themselves in a CWPP. The wild land-urban interface area is one of the identified property areas that qualify under HFRA for the use of this expedited environmental review process.

           The development of a CWPP can assist a local community in clarifying and refining its priorities for the protection of life, property, and critical infrastructure in its wildland-urban interface area. The CWPP brings together diverse federal, state, and local interests to discuss their mutual concerns for public safety, community sustainability, and natural resources. The CWPP process offers a positive, solution-oriented environment in which to address challenges such as local fire-fighting capability, the need for defensible space around homes and housing developments, and where and how to prioritize land management on both federal and nonfederal lands. CWPPs can be as simple or complex as a local community desires.

Local governments and their citizens should be encouraged to work toward consensus concerning their solid waste disposal needs and concerning the types and numbers of solid wastes sites and facilities necessary or desirable in their areas.
          </li>
          <li id="t30-general-ar20-p01-s30-20-100.5ol11dIII">
           State and local efforts in this area must be focused toward the reduction of the volume and toxicity of the waste stream. Realistic waste reduction goals should be established and state and local solid waste management goals should strive to achieve such goals through source reduction, recycling, composting, and similar waste management strategies.
          </li>
          <li id="t30-general-ar20-p01-s30-20-100.5ol11dIV">
           Renewed efforts and new mechanisms are needed to ensure the full participation of the public in all phases of solid waste decision-making. All participants and concerned parties must contribute to a continuing, dedicated effort to inform and educate the public concerning solid waste and its impact on public health and the environment.
          </li>
          <li id="t30-general-ar20-p01-s30-20-100.5ol11dV">
           A strong component of statewide waste management efforts shall be the minimization of illegal disposal of solid wastes through the provision of the appropriate kinds and numbers of solid waste sites and facilities as needed to handle, treat, and dispose of solid waste in all areas of the state.

       Any governing body having jurisdiction is authorized to establish a solid wastes disposal site and facility fund. The governing body having jurisdiction may levy a solid wastes disposal site and facility tax, in addition to any other tax authorized by law, on the taxable property within a county or municipality, the proceeds of which shall be deposited to the credit of said fund and appropriated to pay the cost of land, labor, equipment, and services needed in the operation of solid wastes disposal sites and facilities and for any other solid wastes management purpose in or on behalf of that county or municipality. Any governing body having jurisdiction is also authorized, after a public hearing, to fix, modify, and collect service charges from users of solid wastes disposal sites and facilities or transfer stations for the purpose of financing solid wastes management in that county or municipality. In the event that a countywide solid waste disposal site and facility tax has been imposed with the consent of a majority of the voters in the county, that tax may continue to be collected countywide and may accrue to the county's solid waste disposal site and facility fund, notwithstanding any subsequent taxes as may be levied by any municipalities within the county under this section.

      The board, in fixing and determining the rate of levy, shall take into account the maturing indebtedness for the current and ensuing year on the contracts, bonds, interest on bonds, deficiencies, and defaults of prior years of the district, and shall make provision for the payment thereof. In case the money produced from such levy, together with other revenues of the district, is not sufficient to punctually meet the payments on the contracts, bonds, and interest on bonds of the district, and to pay defaults and deficiencies of the district, then the board, from year to year, shall make such additional levies of taxes as may be necessary for meeting such payments, and notwithstanding any limitations, such levies shall be made and continued until the indebtedness of the district is fully paid.

     <p>
      It is the duty of the governing body to levy the taxes certified to it, as provided in this part 5. It is the duty of all officials charged with the duty of collecting taxes to collect and enforce such taxes at the time, in the form and manner, and with like interest and penalties as other taxes are collected and, when collected, to pay the same to the district ordering its levy and collection. The payment of such collections shall be made monthly to the treasurer of the district and paid into the depository thereof to the credit of the district. All taxes levied under this part 5, together with the penalties for default in payment thereof, and all costs of collecting same, shall constitute a lien, until paid, on and against the property taxed, as in the case of other general taxes.

       The boundaries of any district organized under the provisions of this part 5 may be changed in the manner prescribed in this section, but the change of boundaries of the district shall not impair or affect its organization or its rights in or to property, or any of its rights or privileges whatsoever; nor shall it affect, impair, or discharge any contract, obligation, lien, or charge for or upon which it might be liable or chargeable had any such change of boundaries not been made. The owners of property proposed to be included or excluded may file with the board a petition, in writing, praying that such property be included in or excluded from the district. The petition shall describe the property owned by the petitioners and shall be verified. The petition shall be accompanied by a deposit of money sufficient to pay all costs of the inclusion or exclusion proceedings.

The failure of any person interested to show cause shall be deemed an assent on his part to the inclusion or exclusion of such property as prayed for in the petition. If the petition is granted, the board shall adopt a resolution to that effect and file a certified copy of same with the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the property is located.

To the extent required by section 20 of article X of the Colorado constitution, such bonds shall not be issued unless first approved at an election held for that purpose in accordance with articles 1 to 13 of title 1, C.R.S.

In addition, the county clerk and recorder shall file copies of such assessing resolution after its final adoption by the board with the county assessor and the county treasurer.

If in any court of competent jurisdiction any final assessment made in pursuance of this part 6 is set aside or if for any other reason the board determines it to be necessary to alter any final assessment made pursuant to this part 6, the board, upon notice as required in the making of an original assessment, may make a new assessment in accordance with the provisions of this part 6.

       In case of default in the payment of any installment of principal or interest when due, the county treasurer shall advertise and sell all property concerning which such default is suffered for the payment of the whole of the unpaid assessments thereon. Said advertisements and sales shall be made at the same times, in the same manner, under all the same conditions and penalties, and with the same effect as provided by general law for sales of real estate in default of payment of the general property tax.

       At any sale by the county treasurer of any property for the purpose of paying any special assessment for local improvements made under the provisions of this part 6 in the district, the county treasurer, having written authority from the board, may purchase any such property without paying for the same in cash and shall receive certificates of purchase therefor in the name of the county. The certificates shall be received and credited at their face value, with all interest and penalties accrued, on account of the assessments in pursuance of which the sale was made. The certificates may thereafter be sold by the county treasurer at their face value, with all interest and penalties accrued, and assigned by him to the purchaser in the name of the county. The proceeds of such sale shall be credited to the fund created by resolution for the payment of such assessments respectively. In the event that all bonded indebtedness incurred in payment for said local improvements has been discharged in full, said certificates may be sold by the board for the best price obtainable at public sale, at auction, or by sealed bids in the same manner and under the same conditions as is provided in subsection (4) of this section. The proceeds shall be credited to the general fund of said county. Such assignments shall be without recourse, and the sale and assignments shall operate as a lien in favor of the purchaser and assignee as is provided by law in the case of sale of real estate in default of payment of the general property tax.

       Cumulatively with all other remedies, any county which is the owner of property by virtue of a tax deed, or is the owner of property otherwise acquired, in satisfaction or discharge of the liens represented by such certificates of sale, may sell such property for the best price obtainable at public sale, at auction, or by sealed bids. Such sales shall be after public notice by the county treasurer or the county clerk and recorder to all persons having or claiming any interest in the property to be sold or in the proceeds of such sale by publication of such notice three times, a week apart, in a weekly or daily newspaper of general circulation within the county in which the property is located. Such notice shall describe the property and state the time, place, and manner of receiving bids; except that the time fixed for the sale shall not be less than ten days after the last publication. The county may reject any and all bids. Any interested party, at any time within ten days after the receipt of bids for the sale of property, may file with the county a written protest as to the sufficiency of the amount of any bid made or the validity of the proceedings for the sale. If the protest is denied, such person, within ten days thereafter, shall commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the county from completing the sale. If no such action is commenced, all protests or objections to the sale shall be waived, and the county shall then convey the property to the successful bidder by quitclaim deed.

Any number of certificates may be foreclosed in the same proceeding. In such proceeding the county, as plaintiff, is entitled to all relief provided by law in actions for an adjudication of rights with respect to real property, including actions to quiet title.

All such bonds shall be issued upon estimates approved by the board, and the county treasurer shall preserve a record of the same in a suitable book kept for that purpose.

All moneys collected from such assessments for any improvement shall be applied to the payment of the bonds issued, until payment in full is made of all the bonds, both principal and interest, or to fund or replenish reserve accounts, if any, established to secure the payment of such bonds.

If a county planning commission has been created in the county under the authority of part 1 of article 28 of this title, it is the duty of such planning commission, upon request from the board of county commissioners, to formulate a tentative plan for the formation of such recreation district. The plan shall include recommendations as to the area to be benefited and boundaries and powers of the district.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, in order to protect the environment and the public health, there is a special need to address problems created by the disposal of waste tires and the lack of recycling and beneficial use of waste tires. It is the policy of this state to pursue proposals for recycling and other beneficial use of waste tires in lieu of storage or landfill disposal, and, in addition, it is the intent of the general assembly in adopting this part 14 to encourage the development of techniques for resource recovery, recycling, and reuse of waste tires and to provide for the management of waste tires.

       By May 31, 2015, the commission shall promulgate rules for the implementation and enforcement of this part 14. Until the commission promulgates rules to implement and enforce this part 14, the commission's rules in effect on July 1, 2014, governing waste tires continue to apply to the extent that they do not conflict with this part 14.
      </li>
      <li id="t30-general-ar20-p14-s30-20-1401ol13">
       The department shall enforce this part 14 through its enforcement authorities, including those specified in sections  30-20-113 and  30-20-114.
      </li>
      <li id="t30-general-ar20-p14-s30-20-1401ol14">
       After tires are used for their original intended purpose, they must be used beneficially, recycled, or reused; except that, if authorized by section  30-20-1414 (1)(b), they may be disposed of at a permitted solid waste facility. Because they can be reused, remanufactured, reclaimed, or recycled, waste tires are a recyclable material as defined in section  30-20-101 (4). As recyclable materials, waste tires must be collected, managed, and transported in accordance with the manifest system required by section  30-20-1417 (2) and recycled into tire-derived product, thereby being transformed from a recyclable material into a new product. The department shall consider tires that have been collected under a tire collection program registered pursuant to section  30-20-1411 to have been managed under an approved established tire collection program for purposes of the federal commercial industrial solid waste incinerator rules, 40 CFR part 60 subparts CCCC and DDDD.

     <p>
      Agricultural crop and livestock producers are constantly faced with the problem of new insects, diseases, depletion of soil fertility, lack of information as to market demands and preferences, and of other distributive practices. Some counties have need for more research work than others. Such counties, if placed in a position to provide for agricultural research work with laboratory facilities, management, and some labor, would be able to cooperate with the technical personnel of the state and federal research agencies and better meet these local demands for research work.

        The intent of the former section was concisely stated in the title,
       </b>
       as "An act to require the affairs of the counties of this state to be conducted from the revenues derived from taxation, and to prevent the expenses of any county from exceeding its revenues", and it must be accepted and enforced as it read, as the courts have no right to add to or take from its plain and positive provisions.

        And the evident purpose of that section was
       </b>
       to compel the board in the last quarter of the fiscal year to consider and decide with great care the levy which should be made and the objects to which the moneys which might be realized from it should be put, in other words, the general assembly intended to compel the board of county commissioners to particularize the purposes to which the moneys should be applied, and by this means all subsequent diversion of the public funds to illegal uses because of personal, political, or other considerations, was substantially prevented.

       Under the former section, it was the duty of the board to make the levy so that the assessor could certify the tax list and warrant to the treasurer on or before the first of January, but a failure of the commissioners, or the assessor, to do either within the time specified, in no manner affected the taxpayer and was directory.

       When a judgment is given and rendered against a county of this state in the name of its board of county commissioners or against any county officer in an action prosecuted by or against him in his official capacity or name of office, when the judgment is for money and is a lawful county charge, no execution shall issue thereon, but the same may be paid by the levy of a tax upon the taxable property of said county. When the tax is collected by the county treasurer, it shall be paid over, as fast as collected by him, to the judgment creditor, or his assigns, upon the execution and delivery of proper vouchers therefor; but nothing in this section shall operate to prevent the board of county commissioners from paying any such judgment by a warrant drawn by them upon the ordinary county fund in the county treasury. The power conferred to pay such judgment by a special levy of such tax shall be held to be in addition to the taxing power given and granted to such board to levy taxes for other county purposes. The board of county commissioners shall levy under this law such taxes as shall be sufficient to discharge such judgment in the next fiscal year; but in no event shall such annual levy exceed a total of ten mills for one or more judgments exclusive of mill levies for other county purposes. The board of county commissioners shall continue to levy such taxes, not to exceed a total of ten mills annually, exclusive of mill levies for other county purposes, but in no event less than ten mills if such judgment will not be discharged by a lesser levy until such judgment is discharged.

All levies to pay judgments shall be made as near as possible to raise a sum equal to that due on the judgment, for which payment the tax is levied; but, nevertheless, any excess levied, if such does not exceed the said ten percent of the sum due and desired to be paid, shall not invalidate any tax levy upon or tax sale of real or personal estate made to raise, make, or collect the said sum due and excess.

         Board obligated to act.
        </b>
        Before a county treasurer is authorized to pay a judgment against the county in either of the ways mentioned in this section the board of county commissioners shall take some action in the matter. Stoddard v. Benton, 6
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 508
        </cite>
        (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         It is for the board to determine how far the county will defend against the claim
        </b>
        which has been prosecuted to judgment against it. Stoddard v. Benton, 6
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 508

        (1883).

       <p>
        <b>
         And the county commissioners can not be deprived of their option to pay the judgment against the county by a warrant
        </b>
        drawn on the county fund or of their discretion as to levying a special tax, by a mandamus compelling them to levy a tax to pay the judgment. Bd. of Comm'rs v. King, 67 F. 202 (8th Cir. 1895); Stryker v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 77 F. 567 (8th Cir. 1896); King v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 77 F. 583 (8th Cir. 1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The effect of this section is not to leave it discretionary with the board of commissioners to say whether or not a judgment against a county should ever be paid,
        </b>
        but should be construed as leaving it to the discretion of the board to pay a judgment either by levying the tax or by warrant drawn on the ordinary county fund, when the judgment can be paid by warrant, but if it cannot be paid by warrant on the ordinary fund the special tax must be levied. People ex rel. Reynolds v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 11 Colo. App. 124, 52 P. 748 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Thus discretion as to the levy of the tax is vested in the board of county commissioners,
        </b>
        because they are charged with the administration of the affairs of the county, and familiar with its financial resources and its needs and the condition of its taxpayers. Bd. of Comm'rs v. King, 67 F. 202 (8th Cir. 1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The authority to issue a warrant at once instead of levying a tax contemplated the presence in the treasury of money applicable to the payment of the judgment,
        </b>
        and unless there was money in the treasury to meet the warrant its issuance was unauthorized and the board of commissioners had no alternative except to levy the tax, and the warrants thus issued and received by plaintiff constituted no payment of the judgment. People ex rel. Reynolds v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 11 Colo. App. 124, 52 P. 748 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         In all statutes of this description, the word "may" is interpreted to mean "must",
        </b>
        and the permission is regarded equivalent to a mandate wherever the public interests or the rights of third persons are concerned, the discretion only exists where there are no third parties, either the public or persons, to be injuriously affected by its exercise.

         II. MANDAMUS TO COMPEL PAYMENT.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Unless forbidden by statute, mandamus lies to compel the levy of taxes to pay judgments against a county.

       <p>
        <b>
         And when there is no fund in the treasury applicable to the payment of a judgment against a county,
        </b>
        the judgment creditor is, upon the refusal of the board of county commissioners to levy a tax for the payment of the judgment, entitled to peremptory mandamus to compel them to levy one for that purpose. People ex rel. Rollins v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 7 Colo. App. 229, 42 P. 1032 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         So also in case the commissioners delay, or refuse to make provision for payment of a judgment
        </b>
        against a county, a writ of mandamus will lie to compel them to act. Stoddard v. Benton, 6
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 508
        </cite>
        (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         It is also the proper proceeding to compel an officer to pay warrants drawn on a special fund
        </b>
        who refuses to pay, but to make the remedy available, proof must be made that the officer has funds in his hands available for the purpose. Hockaday v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 1 Colo. App. 362, 29 P. 287 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And a petition for a mandamus is to be construed in the same way and subject to the general rules applied in the construction of an ordinary complaint,
        </b>
        but the certainty to a certain intent in every particular is no longer a prerequisite. Substantial accuracy is all that is necessary. People ex rel. Rollins v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 7 Colo. App. 229, 42 P. 1032 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Also since the merger of a debt into a judgment changes its form, but not its identity
        </b>
        when the judgment is presented to a court for affirmative action, and is sought to be collected by a process not contained within itself, the court will look behind the judgment in order to ascertain from the nature of the original claim what method may be adopted for its enforcement. Bd. of Comm'rs v. People ex rel. New Hampshire Sav. Bank, 16 Colo. App. 215, 64 P. 675 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Conclusiveness of judgment.
        </b>
        In an action for mandamus to compel the board of county commissioners to levy a tax to pay a judgment against a county the judgment is conclusive of all questions which were or might have been litigated in the suit. People ex rel. Reynolds v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 11 Colo. App. 124, 52 P. 748 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No collateral attack.
        </b>
        In mandamus proceeding against a board of county commissioners, the judgment must be accepted as a verity, it cannot be collaterally attacked, and it must be assumed to represent an honest debt, regularly contracted, fairly and honestly put into collectible form. People ex rel. Rollins v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 7 Colo. App. 229, 42 P. 1032 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Insufficient cause of action stated.
        </b>
        In an action of mandamus to compel a board of county commissioners to levy a tax to pay a judgment against the county where the petition shows that the judgment was rendered upon county warrants, the relator must make the same showing that he would have to make if the action had been brought upon the warrants, and unless the petition shows that the board has failed to levy the tax it was required by law to levy to pay such warrants, it fails to state a cause of action, and it is not sufficient to allege that the board has failed and refused to levy a tax to pay the judgment. Bd. of Comm'rs v. People ex rel. New Hampshire Sav. Bank, 16 Colo. App. 215, 64 P. 675 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         When no issue has been made as to the capacity of the county to contract the indebtedness,
        </b>
        it seems to be doubtful whether a judgment against a county on a void obligation can be enforced in any form. Wilder v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 41 F. 512 (D.

       Any claim or demand held by any person against a county shall be presented for audit and allowance to the board of county commissioners of the proper county, in due form of law, before an action in any court shall be maintainable thereon, and all claims, when allowed, shall be paid by a county warrant or order, drawn by said board on the county treasury, upon the proper fund in the treasury, for the amount of such claim. It is the duty of the board of county commissioners to ensure that all warrants and orders issued on or after April 2, 1998, are drawn upon the proper fund in the treasury and that there are sufficient moneys in said fund. Such warrant or order shall be signed by the chairperson of the board, permanent or temporary, and attested by the county clerk and recorder, and said warrant or order shall specify the amount and value of the claim or service for which it is issued and be numbered and dated in the order in which it is issued.

       The general county fund shall be known and designated on the books of the county treasury as the "county general fund", and the general road fund shall be known and carried on the books of said county treasury as the "county road and bridge fund". Such warrants and orders, payable on demand, shall be drawn and issued upon the county treasurer, or against any funds in his hands, only when at the time of drawing and issuing the same there shall be sufficient moneys in the appropriate fund in the treasury to pay such warrants and orders. Whenever there are no moneys in the county treasury of a county to the credit of the proper fund to meet and defray the necessary expenses of the county, it is lawful for the board of county commissioners of such county to provide that county warrants and orders of such county may be drawn and issued against and in anticipation of the collection of taxes already levied for the payment of such expenses to the extent of eighty percent of the total amount of the taxes levied. Warrants and orders so drawn and issued under the provisions of this section shall show upon their faces that they are payable solely from the fund upon which the same are drawn and the taxes levied to form the same when collected and not otherwise.

      <li id="t30-countyfinance-ar25-p01-s30-25-110ol13">
       County warrants and orders may be in such form as the board of county commissioners may provide and may be made payable to the order of the payee or to the bearer. The board of county commissioners may direct the treasurer to pay by electronic transfer any written authorization issued by the board for electronic payment of claims against the county. For purposes of this section, "order" means all orders and authorizations issued by the board of county commissioners for the payment of claims against the county. "Order" includes any check issued by the board of county commissioners and any written authorization issued by the board of county commissioners directing the treasurer to make payment of claims against the county by electronic transfer.

       The person to whom such last-named warrants and orders are allowed and delivered shall be held to have accepted the same in full payment and satisfaction of the claim for which the same were issued; and the obligations of said warrants are limited as stated; and said warrants shall be paid only from the fund drawn upon and the taxes levied, appropriated, collected, or paid into the county treasury to create, constitute, and form said fund. The taxes provided by law therefor shall be credited to said fund until all warrants drawn shall be fully paid, satisfied, and discharged, both principal and interest. Said limited and last-named warrants and orders shall not operate as a debt of said county and shall not be held to add to or increase the debt or indebtedness of said county.

       For the purpose of providing and accumulating moneys for capital expenditures, the board of county commissioners of each county is authorized to create, by resolution, a capital expenditures fund which shall be used solely for capital expenditures. Moneys from any source may be credited to such fund unless otherwise provided by law; except that no moneys dedicated to the payment of general obligation bonds shall be credited to such fund and except that no moneys restricted to county road and bridge funds pursuant to sections  43-2-202 and  43-2-203, C.R.S., and no moneys required to be expended from such funds pursuant to such sections shall be credited to or expended from a capital expenditures fund.

       For the purposes of this section, "capital expenditure" means an expenditure made by a county for long-term additions or betterments, which expenditure, under generally accepted accounting principles, is not properly chargeable as an expense of operation and maintenance. The term includes, but is not limited to, expenditures for the acquisition, development, construction, and renovation of capital facilities, capital projects, and capital equipment.

Moneys raised from such tax shall be credited to the capital expenditures fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the use of any other moneys which are not contained in the capital expenditures fund from being used for capital expenditures. Nothing in this section shall be construed to violate or to exceed the revenue limitation of part 3 of article 1 of title 29, C.R.S.

Said board shall publish, for the period of at least thirty days immediately preceding such special election, in some newspaper published within such county a notice that such question will be submitted at such election.

       <b>
        The issuance of funding bonds, in exchange for valid warrants, is in no sense the creation of a debt;
       </b>
       it is but the substitution of new evidence for a preexisting debt, it changes the form, but does not increase the indebtedness. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Standley, 24
       <cite class="co_code">

        Each bond constitutes a separate and independent cause of action against the county,
       </b>
       and the presumption of its validity goes with it to the end, and must prevail unless it is overcome by a fair preponderance of competent evidence that the warrants for which that particular bond was exchanged evidence unauthorized obligations. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Keene Five-Cents Sav. Bank, 108 F. 505 (8th Cir. 1901); Bd. of Comm'rs v. Standley, 24
       <cite class="co_code">

        Validity of each bond tested by validity of each debt.
       </b>
       When, in compliance with this section, the county issued a bond in exchange for outstanding valid warrants, its validity could in no way be affected by the fact that other bonds in the same series, issued in exchange for invalid warrants, were unauthorized and void, the validity of each bond, therefore, must be tested by the character of the indebtedness for which it is exchanged, because it is an independent contract, and when issued for preexisting indebtedness, it becomes a valid enforceable obligation against the county. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Standley, 24

        Merely because some illegal consideration for some one or more of the bonds of a series may have been given, is not sufficient to invalidate the entire series,
       </b>
       and though some illegal consideration may have entered into all, or some, of the other bonds of the series than those involved, still unless that taint can be traced into the bonds in question, the county may not escape liability thereon. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Linn, 29

        Presumed validity.
       </b>
       In an action upon coupons the county funding bonds issued under this section, where the defense set up in the answer was that the bonds were invalid because the county warrants for which the bonds were exchanged were issued in excess of the limit of indebtedness allowed by the constitution, when plaintiff produced in evidence his coupons and the bonds to which they were attached, regularly and in due form executed by the authorized officers of the county and with the county seal attached, the presumption was that they were valid, and the same presumption attached to the warrants similarly executed and tested which became merged in the bonds, introduced in evidence by the defendant.

        Mandamus.
       </b>
       An action for a money judgment will not lie upon coupons from county refunding bonds, but mandamus is the exclusive remedy, except in certain cases, such as a diversion of the fund, and if the tax has been levied and collected and is in the hands of the treasurer sufficient to pay the coupons the remedy is mandamus against the treasurer to compel payment, also, if the board of county commissioners fails to levy a tax to pay the coupons the remedy is mandamus against the board to compel the levy.

        Burden of proof.
       </b>
       The burden was on defendant to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the alleged indebtedness which was merged in the bonds was invalid because contracted at a time when the county could not lawfully incur further indebtedness. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Linn, 29

      <p>
       In an action upon county bonds, the fact that the county officers failed to preserve in the public records evidence that the indebtedness on which the bonds were founded was contracted after the constitutional limit had been reached does not absolve the county from the ordinary rules relating to the sufficiency of proof or cast upon plaintiff the burden of showing that the bonds were issued for a valid indebtedness.

       Where a county, by an election conducted in substantial conformity to this section, voted to issue bonds as a means of funding its indebtedness, it was held, that the plaintiff, a holder of county warrants constituting a part of such floating debt, was entitled, upon tendering his warrants, and refusal on the part of the county commissioners to issue to him bonds to the amount of such warrants, to a mandamus to compel them to do so.

       Section 6 of art. XI, Colo. Const., providing that any county may contract a debt by loan by the issuance of bonds for the purpose of liquidating the indebtedness incurred prior to December 31, 1886, does not repeal by implication this section, or prevent counties from funding, under it, valid obligations incurred subsequent to said date, viz., December 31, 1886.

        Duty to evaluate vote and amount of indebtedness.

       This section entrusted the power and imposed the duty upon the commissioners to examine, to see and to decide whether or not a favorable vote had been taken, and whether or not the amount of the indebtedness exceeded the limitation, whenever they considered the question of issuing the bonds, and they could not discharge their duty in the issuance of these bonds without a consideration and determination of these questions.

        "Roads" defined.
       </b>
       To restrict the term "roads" to the definition of that term under the conditions of the time, and which had acceptance in the year 1876, when the constitution was adopted, would be most unreasonable, the word has a much broader meaning and may be said to include "overland ways of every character" even though not then envisioned by the framers of the constitution, and the airports of this nation are links in the transportation system, hence runways and landing strips, being a necessary unit of that system, need no longer be regarded as unique or peculiar, hence, they are as logically within the term "roads" as are automobile highways, and the statute authorizing such a bond issue is not unconstitutional.

       a county has the authority to require compliance with a master plan when the county includes compliance with the master plan in its legislatively adopted subdivision regulations so long as the master plan is drafted with sufficient exactitude that proponents of a subdivision are afforded due process, the county does not retain unfettered discretion, and the basis for a county's decision is clear for purposes of a reasoned judicial review.

       A master plan is generally an advisory document, and language in subsection (3)(a) stating that a master plan may be made binding by inclusion in a county's or region's adopted subdivision, zoning, platting, planned unit development, or other similar land development regulations does not mean that including a reference to a master plan in a county's land development regulations necessarily makes the master plan binding in all respects.

     <p>
      The county planning commission shall certify a copy of the plans for zoning all or any part of the unincorporated territory within the county, or any adopted part or amendment thereof or addition thereto, to the board of county commissioners of the county. After receiving the certification of said zoning plans from the commission and before the adoption of any zoning resolutions, the board of county commissioners shall hold a public hearing thereon, the time and place of which at least fourteen days' notice shall be given by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. Such notice shall state the place at which the text and maps so certified by the county planning commission may be examined. No substantial change in or departure from the text or map so certified by the county planning commission shall be made unless such change or departure is first submitted to the certifying county planning commission for its approval, disapproval, or suggestions and, if disapproved, shall receive the favorable vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the board of county commissioners. The county planning commission shall have thirty days after such submission within which to send its report to the board of county commissioners.

        Resubmission not required for nonfundamental changes.

       Where the resolution proposed by the county planning commission was most comprehensive, but it proposed numerous classifications for zoning districts, including five classes of each district, and the board of county commissioners eased the restrictions relating to the location of fur farms, kennels, portable sawmills, and veterinary buildings in an agricultural and forestry district, the change was not so fundamental in nature as to in any wise materially alter the basic overall zoning policy contained in the resolution of the board, and did not necessitate a resubmission of the matter to the commission.

       Where all who appeared for the "first" meeting necessarily learned that the earlier date was incorrect, and presumably, if they made any inquiry, also ascertained that the actual hearing would be held two days later, and the public hearing was exceedingly well attended with about one-half of those persons present opposing with the remaining one-half testifying in support of the resolution, the notice in the instant case was not defective and incorrectly dated notice did not neutralize the "valid" first notice.

     <p>
      The board of county commissioners may provide for the enforcement of the zoning regulations by means of the withholding of building permits, and, for such purpose, may establish and fill a position of county building inspector and may fix the compensation attached to said position, or may authorize one or more administrative officials of the county to assume some or all functions of such position in addition to their customary functions. Such board may also fix a reasonable schedule of fees for the issuance of such permits. After the establishment of such position and the filling of the same, it shall be unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, or change the use of any building or other structure within the unincorporated territory covered by such zoning regulations without obtaining a building permit from such county building inspector. Such building inspector shall not issue any permit unless the plans for the proposed erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or use fully conform to all zoning regulations then in effect.

       Indirect costs, including, for example, services furnished by county manager, county attorney's office, the assessor's office, and various other divisions of county government may be calculated in determining overall costs required to operate that department for purposes of imposing fees for building department services. Fees generated must generally approximate the overall costs of operating the building department to prevent the fees from constituting an unlawful tax in violation of the state constitutional provision mandating uniform property taxation.

       Evidence demonstrated that growth has driven the costs of the county's building department. The evidence also supports the finding that the fees charged by the building department were approximately required to offset the direct and indirect costs of operating the department.

      From time to time the board of county commissioners may amend the number, shape, boundaries, or area of any district, or any regulation of or within such district, or any other provisions of the zoning resolution. Any such amendment shall not be made or become effective unless the same has been proposed by or is first submitted for the approval, disapproval, or suggestions of the county planning commission. If disapproved by such commission within thirty days after such submission, such amendment, to become effective, shall receive the favorable vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the board of county commissioners. Before finally adopting any such amendment, the board of county commissioners shall hold a public hearing thereon, and at least fourteen days' notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given by at least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.

       The board of county commissioners of any county which enacts zoning regulations under the authority of this part 1 shall provide for a board of adjustment of three to five members and for the manner of the appointment of such members. Not more than half of the members of such board may at any time be members of the planning commission. The board of county commissioners shall fix per diem compensation and terms for the members of such board of adjustment, which terms shall be of such length and so arranged that the term of at least one member will expire each year. Any member of the board of adjustment may be removed for cause by the board of county commissioners upon written charges and after a public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as in the case of original appointments. The board of county commissioners may appoint associate members of such board, and, in the event that any regular member is temporarily unable to act owing to absence from the county, illness, interest in a case before the board, or any other cause, his place may be taken during such temporary disability by an associate member designated for that purpose.

       The board of county commissioners shall provide and specify in its zoning or other resolutions general rules to govern the organization, procedure, and jurisdiction of said board of adjustment, which rules shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this part 1. The board of adjustment may adopt supplemental rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part 1 or such general rules.

       Any zoning resolution of the board of county commissioners may provide that the board of adjustment, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate principles, standards, rules, conditions, and safeguards set forth in the zoning resolution, may make special exceptions to the terms of the zoning regulations in harmony with their general purpose and intent. Where feasible, special exception may be made for the purpose of providing access to sunlight for solar energy devices. The board of county commissioners may also authorize the board of adjustment to interpret the zoning maps and pass upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines or similar questions, as they may arise in the administration of the zoning regulations.

       Meetings of the board of adjustment shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board in its rules of procedure may specify. The chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by application to the district court. The court, upon proper showing, may issue subpoenas and enforce obedience by contempt proceedings. All meetings of the board of adjustment shall be open to the public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.

        Section does not conflict with, preempt, or control necessarily implied authority of a local government under the Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act (enabling act) to adopt a reasonable moratorium of sufficient duration to prepare a master plan.
       </b>
       Section pertains to temporary moratoria adopted without a public hearing in connection with the adoption of a zoning plan. This section constitutes an additional grant of authority to local governments in the context of zoning plan adoption: The local government is permitted to adopt a moratorium for a six-month period without a public hearing.

       <b>
        County had authority under the Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act (enabling act) to impose temporary moratorium on developmental approvals concerning certain land within county.
       </b>
       The enabling act is designed to give the local governments additional or supplemental powers for the purposes set forth in the act, including development in hazardous areas, protecting wildlife habitats, protecting areas of historical or archeological significance, controlling population density, and providing for the phasing in of infrastructure. These special considerations, in many instances, supplement those normally involved in creating a zoning master plan or administering a zoning regimen. Accordingly, the enabling act and this article (county planning statute) have different, though complementary, purposes, and the limitation on temporary zoning authorized by this section does not prohibit or limit a moratorium on development for the purpose of conducting studies under the enabling act. Droste v. Bd. of County Comm'rs of Pitkin, 141 P.3d 852 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd, 159 P.3d 601 (Colo. 2007).

       It is unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, or use any building, structure, or land in violation of any regulation in, or of any provisions of, any zoning resolution or any amendment thereof, enacted or adopted by the board of county commissioners under the authority of this part 1. In addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to section  30-28-124, any person, firm, or corporation violating any such regulation, provision, or amendment thereof or any provision of this part 1 may be subject to the imposition, by order of the county court, of a civil penalty in an amount of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. It is within the discretion of the county attorney to determine whether to pursue the civil penalties set forth in this section, the remedies set forth in section  30-28-124, or both. Each day after the issuance of the order of the county court during which such unlawful activity continues shall be deemed a separate violation and shall, in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this section, be the subject of a continuing penalty in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars for each such day. Until paid, any civil penalty ordered by the county court and assessed under this subsection (1) shall, as of recording, be a lien against the property on which the violation has been found to exist. In case the assessment is not paid within thirty days, it may be certified by the county attorney to the county treasurer, who shall collect the assessment, together with a ten percent penalty for the cost of collection, in the same manner as other taxes are collected. The laws of this state for assessment and collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale and redemption of property for taxes, shall apply to the collection of assessments pursuant to this subsection (1). Any lien placed against the property pursuant to this subsection (1) shall be recorded with the clerk and recorder of the county in which the property is located.

       Plain language of this section does not allow postponing access beyond the application for final subdivision approval. Final approval of a subdivision application predicated on obtaining access to the state highway system by an as yet undetermined route would constitute an abuse of discretion because the subdivision might never have the required statutory access.

       Indirect costs, including, for example, services furnished by county manager, county attorney's office, the assessor's office, and various other divisions of county government may be calculated in determining overall costs required to operate that department for purposes of imposing fees for building department services. Fees generated must generally approximate the overall costs of operating the building department to prevent the fees from constituting an unlawful tax in violation of the state constitutional provision mandating uniform property taxation.

       Evidence demonstrated that growth has driven the costs of the county's building department. The evidence also supports the finding that the fees charged by the building department were approximately required to offset the direct and indirect costs of operating the department. Mathematical exactitude is not required. Thus, it was permissible for part of the growth costs to be allocated to the building department as indirect costs. Bainbridge, Inc. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 53 P.3d 646 (Colo. App. 2001).

The board of county commissioners also may authorize the board of review to formulate suggested amendments to the building code for the consideration of the board of county commissioners. In addition, the board of review may adopt substantive rules and regulations based on the provisions of the building code adopted by the board of county commissioners. In no case, however, shall these rules become effective unless a public hearing thereon has been conducted by the board of review. Notice of the hearing, stating its time and place and where the text of the proposed substantive rules and regulations may be inspected, shall be given in the same manner as provided in the initial adoption of the code.

       It is unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, maintain, or use any building, structure, or land in violation of this part 2 or any provisions of the area building code. In addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to section  30-28-209, any person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this part 2 or any provision of the area building code may be subject to the imposition, by order of the county court, of a civil penalty in an amount of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. It is within the discretion of the county attorney to determine whether to pursue the civil penalties set forth in this section, the remedies set forth in section  30-28-209, or both. Each day after the issuance of the order of the county court during which such unlawful activity continues shall be deemed a separate violation and shall in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this section, be the subject of a continuing penalty in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars for each such day. Until paid, any civil penalty ordered by the county court and assessed under this subsection (1) shall, as of recording, be a lien against the property on which the violation has been found to exist. In case the assessment is not paid within thirty days, it may be certified by the county attorney to the county treasurer, who shall collect the assessment, together with a ten percent penalty for the cost of collection, in the same manner as other taxes are collected. The laws of this state for assessment and collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale and redemption of property for taxes, shall apply to the collection of assessments pursuant to this subsection (1). Any lien placed against the property pursuant to this subsection (1) shall be recorded with the clerk and recorder of the county in which the property is located.

The penalty shall be payable immediately by the violator to the county treasurer. In the event that the alleged violation has been cured or otherwise removed and the violator has notified the building inspector of the cure or removal at least five business days prior to the appearance date in the summons, then the county attorney shall so inform the court and request that the action be dismissed without fine or appearance of the defendant.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, in certain areas of the state, property has been conveyed as irregular parcels or as parcels platted prior to establishment of current subdivision regulations. Situations exist where the physical layout of lots conveyed in this manner are not in dispute, but the legal descriptions of these lots contain inaccuracies such that conflicts exist in the written record locating property boundaries. These conflicts in the legal descriptions jeopardize the ability of property owners to utilize and to convey their property. These conflicts often affect a number of properties such that the most efficient means of correcting them is to create a subdivision exemption plat for the area which can be used as a uniform basis for legal descriptions. The inability of property owners to resolve conflicts in legal descriptions is contrary to the public welfare and interferes with efficient and economic development and utilization of land.

        The board of county commissioners of each county shall have authority within its respective county, for flood control purposes only, to remove or cause to be removed any obstruction to the channel of any natural stream which causes a flood hazard, and for such purpose only the board of county commissioners shall have a right of access to any such natural stream, which access shall be accomplished through existing gates and lanes, if possible. Such authority includes the right to modify existing diversion or storage facilities at no expense to the diverter of a water right, but it shall in no way alter or diminish the quality or quantity of water entitled to be received under any vested water right.

Thereafter the board of county commissioners shall negotiate with the owner to reach agreement as to the existence of such conditions and as to the procedures necessary for the elimination thereof. If such agreement is reached, the owner, if he requests, shall be given a reasonable time within which to eliminate such conditions himself, and such agreement may provide for compensation to the owner for such work.

In such court proceedings, it shall be appropriate for the court to consider the necessity for and the reasonableness of the request of the board of county commissioners for access and to award to the owner such payment, if any, as may be proper to compensate him for damages to his property resulting from the flood control work on his property as authorized by the board of county commissioners.

Such tax shall be levied and collected as other county taxes are levied and collected. The tax provisions for the ultimate redemption of such bonds shall be set forth in the ordinance authorizing their issue and shall set forth the years in which such taxes shall be levied for the creation of said redemption fund.
