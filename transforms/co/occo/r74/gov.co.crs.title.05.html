     </b>
     When originally enacted in 1971, articles 1 through 3 and 4 through 6 were based upon the Uniform Consumer Credit Code promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws; however it has been substantially amended in subsequent years and was the subject of a major rewrite in the 2000 session based upon recommendations of the office of the attorney general.

A notification that does not reasonably identify the rights assigned is ineffective.

     <p>
      A creditor may not use multiple agreements with respect to a single consumer credit transaction for the purpose of obtaining a higher finance charge than would otherwise be permitted by this code or to avoid disclosure of an annual percentage rate pursuant to the provisions on disclosure and advertising. Dividing a single consumer credit transaction between a husband and wife shall be presumed to be a violation of this section. The excess amount of finance charge provided for in agreements in violation of this section is an excess charge for the purposes of the provisions on the effect of violations on rights of parties contained in section

     <p>
      With respect to a consumer credit transaction other than one pursuant to a revolving credit account, if any scheduled payment is more than twice as large as the average of all other regularly scheduled payments, the consumer has the right to refinance the amount of that payment at the time it is due at the creditor's prevailing rates for such type of transaction if the consumer meets the creditor's normal credit standards and if the creditor is, at that time, in the business of making such transactions. The creditor shall disclose this right in writing to the consumer at the time the transaction is entered into. These provisions do not apply to the extent that the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the consumer. This section shall not apply to a transaction of a class defined by rule of the administrator promulgated in accordance with article 4 of title 24, C.R.S., as not requiring for the protection of the consumer his or her right to refinance as provided in this section.

      With respect to a consumer credit sale or consumer lease, the seller or lessor may not give or offer to give a rebate or discount or otherwise pay or offer to pay value to the consumer as an inducement for a sale or lease in consideration of the consumer giving to the seller or lessor the names of prospective purchasers or lessees, or otherwise aiding the seller or lessor in making a sale or lease to another person, if the earning of the rebate, discount, or other value is contingent upon the occurrence of an event subsequent to the time the consumer agrees to buy or lease. If a consumer is induced by a violation of this section to enter into a consumer credit sale or consumer lease, the agreement is unenforceable by the seller or lessor and the consumer, at his or her option, may rescind the agreement or retain the goods delivered and the benefit of any services performed without any obligation to pay for them.

      "Home solicitation sale" means a consumer credit sale of goods or services in which the seller or a person acting for the seller personally solicits the sale and the buyer's agreement or offer to purchase is given to the seller or a person acting for the seller at a residence. It does not include a sale made pursuant to a preexisting revolving credit account, a sale made pursuant to prior negotiations between the parties at a business establishment at a fixed location where goods or services are offered or exhibited for sale, a transaction conducted and consummated entirely by mail or telephone, or a sale that is subject to the provisions of the federal "Truth in Lending Act" on the consumer's right to rescind certain transactions.

     <p>
      The people of this state find and declare that payday lenders are charging up to two hundred percent annually for payday loans and that excess charges on such loans can lead Colorado families into a debt trap of repeat borrowing. It is the intent of the people to lower the maximum authorized finance charge for payday loans to an annual percentage rate of thirty-six percent.

For purposes of this paragraph (d), a "low-rate" loan is a loan that carries a current interest rate two percentage points or more below the current yield on United States department of the treasury securities with a comparable maturity. If the loan's current interest rate is either a discounted introductory rate or a rate that automatically steps up over time, then the fully-indexed rate or the fully stepped-up rate, as appropriate, should be used in lieu of the current rate to determine whether a loan is a low-rate loan.

      If you obtain this loan, the lender will have a mortgage in Colorado; this is a deed of trust on your home. You could lose your home, and any money you have put into it, if you do not meet your obligations under the loan. Mortgage loan rates and closing costs and fees vary based on many factors, including your particular credit and financial circumstances, your earnings history, the loan-to-value requested, and the type of property that will secure your loan. The loan rate and fees could vary based on which lender or broker you select.
    You are not required to complete any loan agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application. If you proceed with this mortgage loan, you should also remember that you may face serious financial risks if you use this loan to pay off credit card debts and other debts in connection with this transaction and then later incur significant new credit card charges or other debts. If you continue to accumulate debt after this loan is closed and then experience financial difficulties, you could lose your home and any equity you have in it if you do not meet your mortgage loan obligations.
    Property taxes and homeowner's insurance are your responsibility. Not all lenders provide escrow services for these payments. You should ask your lender about these services.
    Your payments on existing debts contribute to your credit ratings. You should not accept any advice to ignore your regular payments to your existing creditors.

       With respect to a consumer credit transaction, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, after a default consisting only of the consumer's failure to make a required payment, a creditor, because of that default, may neither accelerate maturity of the unpaid balance of the obligation nor take possession of or otherwise enforce a security interest in the goods or the mobile home that are collateral until twenty days after giving the consumer a notice of right to cure described in section  5-5-110. Until the expiration of the minimum applicable period after the notice is given, all defaults consisting of a failure to make the required payment may be cured by tendering to the creditor the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of the tender, without acceleration, plus any unpaid delinquency or deferral charges. Cure restores the consumer to his or her rights under the agreement as though the defaults had not occurred.

       With respect to defaults on the same obligation, other than defaults on an obligation secured by a mobile home, after a creditor has once given the consumer a notice of right to cure described in section  5-5-110, this section gives no right to cure and imposes no limitation on the creditor's right to proceed against the consumer or goods that are collateral with respect to any subsequent default that occurs within twelve months of such notice. With respect to defaults on the same obligation that is secured by a mobile home, this section gives no right to cure and imposes no limitation on the creditor's right to proceed against the consumer or goods that are collateral with respect to any third default that occurs within twelve months of such notice. For the purpose of this section, in connection with revolving credit accounts, the obligation is the consumer's account, and there is no right to cure and no limitation on the creditor's rights with respect to any default that occurs within twelve months after an earlier default as to which a creditor has given the consumer notice of right to cure.

       Unless a creditor has provided the cosignor on a consumer credit transaction with a notice of right to cure that complies with section  5-5-110 and this section, in addition to the notice of right to cure provided to the consumer, the creditor may neither accelerate maturity of the unpaid balance of the obligation as to the cosignor nor report that amount on the cosignor's consumer report with a consumer reporting agency, as defined in section  5-18-103 and 15 U.S.C. sec. 1681a.

       If a creditor has violated the provisions of this code applying to limitations on the schedule of payments or loan term for supervised loans contained in section  5-2-308 or authority to make supervised loans contained in section  5-2-301, the consumer is not obligated to pay the finance charge and has a right to recover from the person violating this code or from an assignee of that person's rights who undertakes direct collection of payments or enforcement of rights arising from the debt a penalty in an amount determined by the court not in excess of three times the amount of the finance charge. With respect to violations arising from consumer credit transactions made pursuant to revolving credit accounts, no action pursuant to this subsection (1) may be brought more than two years after the violation occurred. With respect to violations arising from other consumer credit transactions, no action pursuant to this subsection (1) may be brought more than one year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement with respect to which the violation occurred.

       A consumer is not obligated to pay a charge in excess of that allowed by this code, and if a consumer has paid an excess charge he or she has a right to a refund. A refund may be made by reducing the consumer's obligation by the amount of the excess charge. If the consumer has paid an amount in excess of the lawful obligation under the agreement, the consumer may recover the excess amount from the person who made the excess charge or from an assignee of that person's rights who undertakes direct collection of payments from or enforcement of rights against consumers arising from the debt.

       If a consumer is entitled to a refund and a person liable to the consumer refuses to make a refund within a reasonable time after demand, the consumer may recover from that person a penalty in an amount determined by a court not exceeding the greater of either the amount of the finance charge or ten times the amount of the excess charge. If the creditor has made an excess charge in deliberate violation of or in reckless disregard for this code, the penalty may be recovered even though the creditor has refunded the excess charge. No penalty pursuant to this subsection (3) may be recovered if a court has ordered a similar penalty assessed against the same person in a civil action by the administrator described in section  5-6-114. With respect to excess charges arising from revolving credit accounts, no action pursuant to this subsection (3) may be brought more than two years after the time the excess charge was made. With respect to excess charges arising from other consumer credit transactions, no action pursuant to this subsection (3) may be brought more than one year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was made.

If the court finds after a hearing that there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent is engaging in or is likely to engage in conduct sought to be restrained, it may grant any such temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction it deems appropriate. The court may also issue such orders or judgments as may be necessary to completely compensate or restore to his or her original position any consumer affected by such violation, agreement, or conduct or if there is reasonable cause to believe funds to make refunds of excess charges under this code will not be available at a future date. No bond or other security is required of the administrator before relief under this section may be granted.

In addition, the court may assess a civil penalty of up to one thousand dollars for each violation of this code.
         (1) (a) The administrator may bring a civil action against a creditor for making or collecting charges in excess of those permitted by this code, violating any of the provisions of this code applying to limitations on the schedule of payments or loan term for supervised loans or authority to make supervised loans, or for disclosure violations. An action may relate to transactions with more than one consumer. If it is found that an excess charge has been made, the court shall order the respondent to refund to the consumer the amount of the excess charge and to pay a penalty to the consumer as provided in sections  5-5-201 and  5-5-202. In addition, the court may assess a civil penalty of up to one thousand dollars for each violation of this code.

Refunds and penalties to which the consumer is entitled pursuant to this subsection (1) may be set off against the consumer's obligation.

There shall be no double recovery for refunds of excess charges or a penalty payable to the consumer.

With respect to excess charges arising from other consumer credit transactions, no action pursuant to this subsection (1) may be brought more than four years after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was made.

All or part of the penalty under this subsection (2) may be specifically designated for consumer and creditor education. No civil penalty pursuant to this subsection (2) may be imposed for violations of this code occurring more than four years before the action is brought or for making unconscionable agreements or engaging in a course of fraudulent or unconscionable conduct.

         Recovery of that compensation may be pursued as prejudgment interest in accordance with the terms of this section, or in circumstances in which statutory interest would not be available, it may be sought as moratory interest which recognizes interest as a part of compensatory damages.

          In historical perspective.
         </b>
         The exaction or taking of interest or compensation for the use of money was regarded as usurious, whether moderate or excessive, both in biblical times and by the early common law prior to the reign of Henry VIII. It seems to have been held by the church that the taking of interest was actually sinful as against the laws of God and morality and by the courts that it was unlawful on the theory of the classical and medieval economists from the time of Aristotle that money was only a medium of exchange and naturally barren and unproductive. By the 16th century the gap between religious theory and commercial practice had been further narrowed, and the new protestant ethics regarded only excessive exactions as usury. In the United States, the courts have always viewed the allowance of interest with greater favor than have the courts in England. The English common law has never been suited to the conditions existing in this country, and the American courts have never doubted the right to interest where it has been expressly contracted for, or where an undertaking to pay interest may be implied from the usages of trade.

          Some kind of notice must be given debtor before creditor can recover interest.

         The only reasonable construction of this section is that even though a debtor may be unable to pay, and a demand therefor be excusable to that extent, still there must be some notice to him of some kind, either by the institution of a suit, or otherwise, of the creditor's intention to terminate the relation of debtor and creditor by declaring the maturity of a debt, or some act of the creditor evidencing such desire and intention, before he can be allowed to recover interest.

          Hence, no interest on bank account until demand is made.
         </b>
         In cases of general deposits in a bank, unless there be some agreement or usage to the contrary, the undertaking of the bank is only to repay upon demand. Such an account, therefore, does not become due under this section until demand is made for it, and the bank is not in default, or liable to respond in damages, until such demand and refusal. Hence, under this general rule, a plaintiff is not entitled to receive interest on his deposit, unless the circumstances were such as to legally excuse him from making a demand prior to the time when he did make it.

         A letter from an accounting firm satisfied the need for a formal demand for payment, under the theory of wrongful withholding. The parties had retained the firm to examine their mutual accounts and determine their respective obligations. The firm determined the amount of each party's debt and communicated the amounts in a letter to each party. The letter established a present expectation of payment of which both parties were aware.

The rate of interest shall be deemed to be excessive of the limit under this section only if it could have been determined at the time of the stipulation by mathematical computation that such rate would exceed an annual rate of forty-five percent when the rate of interest was calculated on the unpaid balances of the debt on the assumption that the debt is to be paid according to its terms and will not be paid before the end of the agreed term.

         If rate specified greatly exceeds the real value of money it will be disallowed as a penalty.
        </b>
        Under this section the parties may determine the value of the use of money before it falls due, and their estimate of its value, after it falls due, is the true measure of damages, until it is shown to be incorrect. Since the law seeks to indemnify the plaintiff for the loss he has suffered by the breach of contract, the rate fixed by the parties affords a just rule of indemnity. If, however, the rate of interest specified in the contract greatly exceeds the real value of the money, it is a penalty for the nonpayment of the principal sum, rather than a just recompense for detaining it, and will not be allowed.

        further, there is no requirement that interest must be specifically requested. This section makes no exception for attorney fees; post-judgment interest on attorney fees is required when the judgment is affirmed on appeal.

        Each licensee shall maintain at all times and each applicant shall file, prior to the issuance of any license to the applicant, a bond in the sum of twelve thousand dollars plus an additional two thousand dollars for each ten thousand dollars or part thereof by which the average monthly sums remitted or owed to all of its clients during the previous year exceed fifteen thousand dollars; or, in the alternative, an applicant or licensee shall present evidence of a savings account, deposit, or certificate of deposit of the same sum and meeting the requirements of section  11-35-101. The total amount of the bond shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars and shall be in favor of the attorney general of the state of Colorado for use of the people of the state of Colorado and the administrator. The bond shall be executed by the applicant or licensee as principal and by a corporation that is licensed by the commissioner of insurance to transact the business of fidelity and surety insurance as surety. If any such surety, during the life of the bond, cancels the bond or reduces the penal sum of the bond, the surety immediately shall notify the administrator in writing. The administrator shall give notice to the licensee that the bond has been cancelled or reduced and that the licensee's license shall automatically expire unless a new or increased bond with proper sureties is filed within thirty days after the date the administrator received the notice, or on a later date as is stated in the surety's notice.
       </li>
       <li id="t05-debtmanagement-ar16-s5-16-124ol12">
        The bond shall include a condition that the licensee shall, upon demand in writing made by the administrator, pay over to the administrator for the use of any client from whom any debt is taken or received for collection by the licensee the proceeds of the collection, less the charges for collection in accordance with the terms of the agreement made between the licensee and the client.
       </li>
       <li id="t05-debtmanagement-ar16-s5-16-124ol13">
        A client may file with the administrator a duly verified claim as to money due the client for money collected by a licensee. If the administrator makes a preliminary determination that a claim meets the requirements of this section, the administrator shall make a demand for the amount claimed. The demand may be made on the licensee, the surety, or both.
       </li>
       <li id="t05-debtmanagement-ar16-s5-16-124ol14">
        If a receiver has been appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction in the state of Colorado to take charge of the assets of any licensee, the receiver, upon the written consent of the administrator, may demand and receive payment on the bond from the surety and, upon order of the court, may bring suit upon the bond in the name of the receiver, without joining the administrator as a party to the action.

        If a client has filed a duly verified claim with the administrator, who has refused to make demand upon the licensee or surety, the client may bring suit against the licensee or surety on the bond for the recovery of money due from the licensee without assignment of the bond to the client. Nothing in this section shall preclude a client from making a demand on both the licensee and the surety.

Such bond may be enforced in the manner described in this section, by a receiver appointed to take charge of the assets of any licensee, or by any client if the administrator refuses to act. The aggregate liability of the surety, for any and all claims that may arise under the bond, shall not exceed the penalty of the bond.

        Any licensee, at any time, may file a new bond with the administrator. Any surety may file with the administrator notice of withdrawal as surety on the bond of any licensee. Upon filing of a new bond or on expiration of thirty days after the filing of notice of withdrawal as surety by the surety, the liability of the former surety for all future acts of the licensee shall terminate, except as provided in subsection (9) of this section. The administrator shall cancel the bond given by any surety company upon being advised its license to transact the business of fidelity and surety insurance has been revoked by the commissioner of insurance and shall notify the licensee.

        No action shall be brought upon any bond required to be given and filed, after the expiration of two years from the surrender, revocation, or expiration of the license issued thereunder. After the expiration of two years, all liability of the surety upon the bond shall cease if no action has been commenced upon the bond before the expiration of the period.

        In lieu of an individual surety bond, the administrator may authorize a blanket bond covering qualifying licensees in the sum of two million dollars in favor of the attorney general of the state of Colorado for use of the people of the state of Colorado and the administrator. Each new and renewal applicant shall pay a fee in an amount determined by the administrator to offset the applicant's share of the blanket bond.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds and declares that the use of consumer reporting agencies is increasing rapidly as consumer credit transactions become the rule rather than the exception in every-day consumer purchasing. Consumer credit reports by consumer reporting agencies may report on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, debts, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living as factors to establish a consumer's eligibility for credit insurance or employment. When a consumer reporting agency undertakes a business that has the potential to profoundly affect an individual consumer's life, whether for good or ill, it is incumbent upon such agencies to ensure that the information they are providing is accurate. Inaccurate consumer credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence in the banking system. There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumer's rights. The general assembly further finds and declares that, in the event the information provided by a consumer reporting agency in a consumer credit report is inaccurate, the consumer has the right to have that information corrected in a swift and uncomplicated way.

     </p>
     <br/>
     <p>
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p>
      You may obtain a security freeze on your consumer report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge, except as provided by law. You have a right to place a security freeze on your consumer report to prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your consumer report without your express authorization or approval, except as the law allows.
    You will not be initially charged to place a security freeze on your consumer report. However, you will be charged a fee of no more than ten dollars to temporarily lift the freeze for a period of time, to permanently remove the freeze from your consumer report, or when you make a subsequent request for a freeze to be placed on your consumer report. As well, you may be charged a fee of no more than twelve dollars to temporarily lift the freeze for a specific party.
    The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your consumer report, within five business days you will be provided procedures for the temporary release of your consumer report to a specific party or parties or for a period of time after the security freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide the proper information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the consumer report or the period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the consumer report.
    A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a security freeze on a consumer report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request.
    A security freeze does not apply to circumstances where you have an existing account relationship, and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities.
    You should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gains access to the personal and financial information in your consumer report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding new loans, credit, mortgage, insurance, government services or payments, rental housing, employment, investment, license, cellular phone, utilities, digital signature, internet credit card transaction, or other services, including an extension of credit at the point of sale. You should plan ahead and lift a security freeze either completely if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain creditor a few days before actually applying for new credit.
    You have the right to bring a civil action or submit to binding arbitration against a consumer reporting agency to enforce an obligation under the security freeze law after following specified dispute procedures and having received the necessary notice.

     <p>
      You may obtain from a consumer reporting agency a credit report security freeze for your child who is under sixteen years of age or for your legal ward. If a consumer report has not yet been created for your child or legal ward, you may request that a consumer reporting agency create a consumer record for him or her and place a security freeze on his or her consumer record. You will not be charged to have a security freeze placed on your child's or legal ward's consumer report or to have a consumer record created for your child or legal ward and to have a security freeze placed on the consumer record. You will not be charged to have a security freeze placed on or removed from your child's or legal ward's credit report or record.

         The ability to obtain and use credit has become of great importance to consumers, who have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their creditworthiness and credit standing.

     <p>
      You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau at no charge once per year with additional copies available for a small fee. You have a right to dispute inaccurate information by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, you have no right to have accurate information removed from your credit bureau report. Under the federal "Fair Credit Reporting Act", the credit bureau must remove accurate negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old. Bankruptcy can be reported for 10 years. Even when a debt has been completely repaid, your report can show that it was paid late if that is accurate. You have a right to sue a credit repair company that violates the "Colorado Credit Services Organization Act". This law prohibits deceptive practices by repair companies. The "Colorado Credit Services Organization Act" also gives you a right to cancel your contract for any reason within 5 working days from the date you sign it.
    The Federal Trade Commission enforces the federal "Fair Credit Reporting Act". For more information, call or write the Federal Trade Commission. The administrator of the "Uniform Consumer Credit Code" enforces the "Colorado Credit Services Organization Act". For more information, call or write the Colorado attorney general's office.

        The Uniform Debt-Management Services Act does not violate the separation of powers doctrine of the Colorado constitution by regulating attorneys.

        The Act does not violate the commerce clause or the privileges and immunities clause of the United States constitution with respect to regulating out-of-state attorneys because the Act is facially neutral and any burden on out-of-state attorneys is incidental.

        The Act's exemptions from regulation should be applied narrowly because the Act was enacted to protect consumers and is remedial in nature.

       For a nonlawyer assistant to be covered under the legal services exemption to regulation under the Act, a person must at a minimum work for an attorney and under the attorney's supervision. Coffman v. Williamson, 2015 CO 35, 348 P.3d 929.

        The legal services exemption only extends to a nonlawyer assistant if the nonlawyer assistant works for the attorney providing debt-management services.
       </b>
       A nationwide legal software company owned and operated by nonlawyers that contracted with lawyers to provide debt-management services did not fall within the legal services exemption because the legal software company did not act on behalf of the lawyers in the provision of debt-management services; rather, the lawyers acted on behalf of the legal software company.
