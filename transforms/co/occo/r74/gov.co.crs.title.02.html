       Colorado's apportionment of congressional representatives pursuant to the 2000 federal census increased from six representatives to seven representatives. In November 2002, Congressional elections were held in seven districts described in a redistricting plan created by the district court for the city and county of Denver and affirmed in Beauprez v. Avalos, 42 P.3d 642 (Colo. 2002). The districts, however, described in section <cite class="occo"><a href="gov.co.crs.title.02.html#t02-congressionaldistricts-ar01-s2-1-101ol11" target="_self"> 2-1-101 (1)</a></cite> were created in Senate Bill 03-352 for use in congressional elections to be held in November 2004 and thereafter. Senate Bill 03-352 was the subject of several court actions:

        <li id="t02-editor'snote:ol11a">
         Keller v. Davidson was filed in the district court for the city and county of Denver and subsequently removed to federal district court. On January 23, 2004, the district court denied a motion to file amended counterclaims and stayed the proceedings pending a final ruling in Salazar v. Davidson, discussed below. The district court opinion appears at 299 F. Supp. 2d (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 2004</cite>). On October 15, 2004, the district court dismissed the matter.
        </li>
        <li id="t02-editor'snote:ol11b">
         Salazar v. Davidson, case number 03SA133, and the related case of Davidson v. Salazar, case number 03SA147, were original actions filed with the Colorado Supreme Court. The Colorado Supreme Court held Senate Bill 03-352 unconstitutional and ordered the secretary of state to conduct congressional elections according to the plan approved in Beauprez v. Avalos. People ex rel. Salazar v. Davidson, 79 P.2d 1221 (Colo. 2003). The United States Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari in Colorado General Assembly v. Salazar, 541 U.S. 1093 (2004).

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the state of Colorado shall be divided into districts pursuant to the official figures of the most recent decennial census of the United States. The general assembly further finds and declares that such figures are the most reliable data that the state has available and that the use of any other data or of any data adjustments may create a serious risk of inaccuracy and injustice in establishing congressional districts to represent the citizens of Colorado.

       </h4>
       <p>
        <b>
         Each of the nonconstitutional factors that a court may consider must be interpreted in light of the foundational goal of congressional redistricting under the United States constitution: Fair and effective representation for all citizens.
        </b>
        The minimization of disruption of existing boundary lines is only one among many factors that the court must balance. The statute gives the trial court broad discretion in striking this balance, and the consideration of competitiveness is consistent with the ultimate goal of maximizing fair and effective representation. The trial court's adoption of the Moreno/South map reasonably balanced these many factors and is supported by the evidence, and therefore was not an abuse of discretion. Hall v. Moreno, 2012 CO 14, 270 P.3d 961.
       </p>
       <p>
        The incorporation of several of Denver's southern suburbs into the first district was reasonable, both because they share a community of interest and because incorporating suburbs elsewhere would have required splitting municipal boundaries. Current communities of interest, including the I-70 corridor, Rocky Mountain national park, the beetle-kill forest infestation, and higher education and its associated health and high-tech industries, justify the court's adoption of the second district, while the community of interest for this district from 10 years ago, the cleanup of Rocky Flats, is no longer relevant. The third district minimizes disruption of the existing district lines, thus maintaining communities of interest that remain important today. Hall v. Moreno, 2012 CO 14, 270 P.3d 961.
       </p>
       <p>
        The addition of rural Douglas, Arapahoe, and Adams counties into the fourth district, in part to compensate for the transfer of Larimer county into the second district, is supported by those areas' community of interest in agriculture and drought, and it was appropriate for the court to look to the near future in identifying pending oil and gas development in these areas as a community of interest. The fifth district is largely unchanged other than the removal of Lake county, as necessitated by the requirement of population equality. Hall v. Moreno, 2012 CO 14, 270 P.3d 961.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sixth district puts Aurora in a single district, unites the newer and fast-developing suburbs from northeast of Denver to southwest of Denver, and properly creates a competitive district. Similarly, the seventh district becomes more compact by including the older suburbs from north of Denver through Jefferson county, which share a community of interest in clean energy and replacing aging infrastructure. The seventh district also includes a significant Latino community of interest and properly creates a competitive district. Hall v. Moreno, 2012 CO 14, 270 P.3d 961.

        The voters of Colorado considered and overwhelmingly approved legislatively referred measures at the 2018 general election to establish balanced commissions to set district lines for both the United States house of representatives and the Colorado general assembly.

       <li id="t02-congressionaldistricts-ar01-s2-1-103ol12">
        The voters were aware that among the protections provided by these referred measures was the incorporation of the protections provided by federal law including the "Voting Rights Act of 1965", as amended.

       <li id="t02-congressionaldistricts-ar01-s2-1-103ol13">
        Because of a misprint in the measures referring these constitutional amendments to the voters, the federal statute was correctly cited as "the federal 'Voting Rights Act of 1965'" but incorrectly cited as "52 U.S.C. sec. 50301, as amended" when the proper citation is "52 U.S.C. sec. 10301 et seq., as amended."

        The general assembly finds and declares that voter intent was clear and should not be frustrated by a clerical error in referring to a federal law that has long been applied by federal courts and the Colorado courts in the redistricting context and was intended to be applied based on the measures' context and legislative analyses provided to voter households in advance of the 2018 general election.

       2-2-316. Legislative declaration - travel by members - during adjournment.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Considering the greatly improved highways and airways of this state which permit greater mobility with less cost in money and time, considering the increasing length of legislative sessions, the increasing complexity and importance of the problems presented, and the benefits to be derived from frequent contact between legislator and constituents, and considering the desirability of preserving the concept of part-time citizen-legislators and, therefore, the need to allow them a reasonable opportunity to attend to their own personal, family, and business affairs even during sessions of the general assembly, it is hereby declared to be necessary, within the meaning of the state constitution and in the best interests of the general assembly and the state of Colorado, that members of the senate and house of representatives travel to their homes or other locations within their districts and back to the capitol during sessions of the general assembly when the house to which they belong is in adjournment for periods not exceeding seventy-two hours.

       There is hereby created a legislative audit committee, referred to in this part 1 as the "committee". The committee consists of four senators, two from each major political party, to be appointed by the president and the minority leader of the senate, respectively, with the approval of a majority of the members elected to the senate and four representatives, two from each major political party, to be appointed by the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives, respectively, with the approval of a majority of the members elected to the house of representatives. Appointments to the committee shall be made no later than sixty days after the convening of the first regular session of the general assembly held in each odd-numbered year.

         For many years now, residential areas in numerous parts of the state are regularly threatened by a close proximity to wildfires and, tragically, during the spring and summer of 2012, Colorado wildfires resulted in the loss of life and extensive property damage, including the destruction of homes affecting thousands of people;

         Since wildfires cause annual harm to many areas of the state and those residing in such areas, wildfire prevention and mitigation is a matter of extreme importance throughout the state and an issue demanding critical attention from the general assembly on a regular basis.

In creating a permanent interim committee to address matters relating to wildfires, the general assembly intends that issues relating to wildfire prevention and mitigation receive sufficient legislative scrutiny and public participation.

     The primary task in interpreting a statute
    </b>
    is to give it a construction and interpretation that will render it effective in accomplishing the purpose for which it was enacted. Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Pinder, 812 P.2d 645 (Colo. 1991); Walgreen Co. v. Charnes, 859 P.2d 235 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>

       <b>
     A court should look first to the plain language of the statute,
    </b>
    and the words used should be given effect according to their plain and ordinary meaning. Farmers Group, Inc. v. Williams, 805 P.2d 419 (Colo. 1991); Martin v. Montezuma-Cortez Sch. Dist. RE-1, 841 P.2d 237 (Colo. 1992); People v. Valencia, 888 P.2d 319 (Colo. App. 1994), aff'd, 906 P.2d 115 (Colo. 1995); Organ v. Jorgensen, 888 P.2d 336 (Colo. App. 1994); Reg'l Transp. Dist. v.

       <b>
     If the language of a statute is plain and its meaning clear,
    </b>
    it must be applied as written. Heagney v. Schneider, 677 P.2d 446 (Colo. App. 1984); In Interest of A.R.W., 903 P.2d 10 (Colo. App. 1994); Catholic Health Initiatives Colo. v. City of Pueblo, 207 P.3d 812 (Colo. 2009).
      </p>

       If statutory language is clear and the legislative intent appears to be reasonably certain, there is no need to resort to other rules of statutory construction. S.W. Devanney &amp; Co., Inc. v. Griffin, 757 P.2d 1088 (Colo. App. 1988), aff'd, 775 P.2d 555 (Colo. 1989); In the Interest of R.C., 775 P.2d 27 (Colo. 1989); Colonial Penn v. Colo. Ins.

      <p>
       <b>
     The court will not resort to interpretive rules of statutory construction
    </b>
    and will apply the statute as written when the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. Vaughan v. McMinn, 945 P.2d 404 (Colo. 1997); Waneka v. Clyncke, 157 P.3d 1072 (Colo. 2007); Kenna v. Huber, 179 P.3d 189 (Colo. App. 2007), rev'd on other grounds, 205 P.3d 1158 (Colo. 2009).

       <b>
        Consideration of results of construction.
       </b>
       In case of a dispute as to the meaning of a statute, the court should consider the results of the construction urged. No provision of the law should be interpreted in a way which requires an impossible task. People in Interest of K.M.J., 698 P.2d 1380 (Colo. App. 1984).

      <p>
       <b>
        If statutory language is uncertain as to its intended scope,
       </b>
       with the result that the statutory text lends itself to alternative constructions, then a court may appropriately look to pertinent legislative history in determining which alternative construction is more in accordance with the legislative purpose. Fraternal Order, No. 27 v. Denver, 914 P.2d 483 (Colo. App. 1995).

       <b>
     The fact that a jury has twice been unable to agree upon a verdict

     When the general assembly substantively amends a statute,

      <p>
       <b>
        Unless a contrary intent is expressed in the statute,

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     A legislative intent to change the meaning of statutes

      </p>
      <p>
       When a statute is amended, the judicial construction previously placed upon the statute is deemed approved by the general assembly to the extent that the provision remains unchanged. Creacy v.

       The construction of a statute, ordinance, or regulation is not one of fact, to be resolved with the assistance of retained experts. Rather, it is a question of law for the courts. Walcott v. Total Petroleum, Inc., 964 P.2d 609 (Colo. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Whether the general assembly intends a statutory provision to be directory or jurisdictional
       </b>
       requires consideration of the legislative history, the language of the statute, its subject matter, the importance of its provisions, their relation to the general object intended to be accomplished by the act, and, finally, whether or not there is a public or private right involved. DiMarco v. Dept. of Rev., MVD, 857 P.2d 1349 (Colo. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The factor which most heavily weighs in favor of a mandatory construction is the use of the word "shall" in the provision;

       unless the context indicates otherwise, the word "shall" generally indicates that the general assembly intended the provision to be mandatory. DiMarco v. Dept. of Rev., MVD, 857 P.2d 1349 (Colo. App. 1993).

       2-4-204. Severability of statutory provisions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If any provision of a statute is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the remaining provisions of the statute are valid, unless it appears to the court that the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so dependent upon, the void provision that it cannot be presumed the legislature would have enacted the valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court determines that the valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.

     Statute requiring the costs of conducting an election be a county charge prevails over more general statute pertaining to state reimbursement of county expenditures generally.
    </b>
    Even though statute pertaining to reimbursement of county costs is more recent than the election statute, there is no manifest intent that it prevail in a conflict with the other statute. Statute requiring that the costs of conducting an election be a county charge, § <cite class="occo"><a href="gov.co.crs.title.01.html#t01-general,primary,recall,andcongressionalvacancyelections-ar05-p05-s1-5-505ol11" target="_blank"> 1-5-505 (1)</a></cite>, and the statute requiring state reimbursement to counties for costs associated with an increased level of service, § <cite class="occo"><a href="gov.co.crs.title.29.html#t29-generalprovisions-ar01-p03-s29-1-304.5ol11" target="_blank"> 29-1-304.5 (1)</a></cite>, are in irreconcilable conflict. However, § <cite class="occo"><a href="gov.co.crs.title.01.html#t01-general,primary,recall,andcongressionalvacancyelections-ar05-p05-s1-5-505ol11" target="_blank"> 1-5-505 (1)</a></cite>, which pertains only to election funding, is more specific than § <cite class="occo"><a href="gov.co.crs.title.29.html#t29-generalprovisions-ar01-p03-s29-1-304.5ol11" target="_blank"> 29-1-304.5 (1)</a></cite>, which broadly applies its reimbursement requirement to most existing state programs. Although § 29-1-304.5 (1) was adopted after § 1-5-505 (1), there is no manifest intent that it should prevail in a conflict with the other statute. Rather, the intent of the legislature was to prioritize citizens' access to free and fair elections over convenience or cost savings to counties. Thus, § 1-5-505 (1) should prevail over § 29-1-304.5 (1), notwithstanding that this increase in service may create additional costs to the county. Gessler v. Doty,<cite class="COA">2012 COA 4</cite>, 272 P.3d 1131.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     The program of revision and publication of statutes is based upon laws that exist as enacted by the general assembly
    </b>
    and as construed and defined by the courts. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     And not on laws as they were originally enacted if they have been repealed
    </b>
    by construction of the courts or by the general assembly. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     In such circumstances they do not exist at all.
    </b>
    Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     But any law or statute which is reenacted, amended or revised,
    </b>
    so far as it is the same as that of a prior law, shall be construed as a continuation of such law and not as a new enactment or provision. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961); Estes Park Bank v. Shanks, 794 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     And so far as it is the same in substantial intent, effect and meaning,
    </b>
    it shall be given effect as though continuation of such law. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Also where a statute is reenacted in the substantial form of a preexisting statute without change of legal effect,
    </b>
    it is effective or not effective as of its original and preexisting status. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     When a statute is amended, it is presumed that the legislature intended to change the law.
    </b>
    Robles v. People, 811 P.2d 804 (Colo. 1991); Douglas County Bd. of Eq. v. Fidelity Castle Pines, 890 P.2d 119 (Colo. 1995); Powell v. City of Colo. Springs, 131 P.3d 1129 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd, 156 P.3d 461 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       This presumption is rebuttable, but, in a criminal case controlled by an earlier version of statute that was not ambiguous, there was no room for interpretation; prior statute would be applied according to its terms regardless of subsequent amendment that assertedly "clarified any ambiguity" but was found to change meaning of statute. Robles v. People, 811 P.2d 804 (Colo. 1991); Douglas County Bd. of Eq. v. Fidelity Castle Pines, 890 P.2d 119 (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       This presumption may be rebutted only by a showing that the general assembly intended to clarify an existing ambiguity in that law. Thus, if an amendment clarifies such an ambiguity, the law remains unchanged by the amendment, and it may provide convincing evidence of the general assembly's intent to apply the amendment retroactively. Powell v. City of Colo. Springs, 131 P.3d 1129 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd, 156 P.3d 461 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       To determine whether an amendment clarifies or changes a statute, the court must examine the plain language used by the general assembly, the legislative history surrounding the amendment, and any ambiguity in the provision before it was amended. Powell v. City of Colo. Springs, 131 P.3d 1129 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd, 156 P.3d 461 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment of a statute creates a rebuttable presumption that a change in the law was intended. When more specific sections, however, are added to a general statutory provision, the addition may indicate a legislative intent to clarify the existing statute or to resolve an ambiguity in the former law. Colo. Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Bethesda Care Ctr., Inc., 867 P.2d 4 (Colo. App. 1993); People ex rel. T.T., 128 P.3d 328 (Colo. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     And where such a reenacted statute has been construed,
    </b>
    the force and effect of such construction remains an integral part of the reenacted statute. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961); Rauschenberger v. Radetsky, 745 P.2d 640 (Colo. 1987); Messler v. Phillips, 867 P.2d 128 (Colo. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     And where statutes are reenacted the construction previously placed upon them is deemed to have been approved by the general assembly
    </b>
    in making the enactments and with the understanding the former construction will be adhered to. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961); Rauschenberger v. Radetsky, 745 P.2d 640 (Colo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Because contemporaneous construction of legislation, acquiesced in for many years by the authorities charged with its enforcement,
    </b>
    is entitled to great weight in determining the intent of the framers. Sec. Life &amp; Accident Co. v. Heckers, 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 455</cite>, 495 P.2d 225 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the absence of clear error, such a long established construction should not be overturned or disregarded. Sec. Life &amp; Accident Co. v. Heckers, 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 455</cite>, 495 P.2d 225 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Therefore, when the general assembly repeatedly reenacts a statute which has theretofore received a settled judicial construction, there can be no doubt as to the legislative intent.
    </b>
    Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     It must be considered that the statute is reenacted with the understanding
    </b>
    that the former construction will be adhered to. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 429</cite>, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).

     The necessities of modern legislation dealing with complex economic and social problems have led to judicial approval of broad standards for administrative action,

        <b>
     Whether constitution or statute is involved, that interpretation which, brushing aside minor objections and trivial technicalities,
    </b>
    effectuates the intent of the act, is a broad interpretation, and that which, regarding such objections and technicalities, fails to do so, is narrow. In re Senate Resolution No. 2, 94<cite class="co_code">Colo. 101</cite>, 31 P.2d 325 (1933).

       <p>
        <b>
     To do this the court should strive to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the general assembly.
    </b>
    A statute imperfect in its details is not void unless impossible of execution. The title of an act may be looked to in seeking the legislative intent, and the preamble as well. W.

       When the general assembly creates statutory programs which are not required by federal law and which offer and provide services or assistance or both to persons in this state, the general assembly gives rise to a reasonable expectation that such services or assistance or both will be provided by the state in a manner consistent with the statutes which created the programs. However, the general assembly does not commit itself or the taxpayers of the state to the provision of a particular level of funding for such programs and does not create rights in the ultimate recipient to a particular level of service or assistance or both. The general assembly intends that the level of funding, and thus the level of service or assistance or both, shall be in the full and complete discretion of the general assembly, consistent with the statute which created the program.
      </li>
      <li id="t02-statutes-constructionandrevision-ar04-p02-s2-4-216ol12">
       In the statutes creating some of these programs, the general assembly expressly conditions any rights arising under such programs by the use of the words "within available appropriations" or "subject to available appropriations" or similar words of limitation. The purpose of the use of these words of limitation is to reaffirm the principles set forth in subsection (1) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t02-statutes-constructionandrevision-ar04-p02-s2-4-216ol13">
       At the time such a program is created, the general assembly appropriates funds for its implementation, taking into account many factors, including but not limited to the availability of revenues, the importance of the program, and needs of recipients when balanced with the needs of recipients under other state programs. The amount of the initial appropriation indicates a program's priority in relation to other state programs. The general assembly reasonably expects that the priority of the program will be subject to annual changes which will be reflected in the modification of the annual appropriation for the program. If the general assembly desires a substantive change in the program, or to eliminate the program, that can be accomplished by amendment of the statutory law which created the program.
      </li>
      <li id="t02-statutes-constructionandrevision-ar04-p02-s2-4-216ol14">
       It is the purpose of the general assembly, through the enactment of this section, to clarify that the rights, if any, created through the enactment of statutory programs are subject to substantial modification through the annual appropriation process, so long as the modification is consistent with the statute which created the program.

    passed in pursuance of a special charter, the repeal of the ordinance will leave the general law in force within the city. Heinssen v. State, 14<cite class="co_code">Colo. 228</cite>, 23 P. 995 (1890).
      </p>

       <b>
     Also, the rule against implied revival applies only where the statute itself is repealed,

    and not where it is left in force. Terminal Drilling Co. v. Jones, 84<cite class="co_code">Colo. 279</cite>, 269 P. 894 (1928).

    This section has no application to acts other than those which relate to a penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under a repealed statute.

         II. EFFECTS OF SECTION ON REPEALED OR AMENDED STATUTES.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
     The repeal, revision, amendment or consolidation of any statute shall not have the effect
    </b>
    to alter, modify or change in whole or in part any liability, which shall have been incurred under such statute unless expressly so provided. Colo. Fuel &amp; Iron Corp. v. Indus. Comm'n, 148<cite class="co_code">Colo. 557</cite>, 367 P.2d 597 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     General rule in civil proceedings regarding amendatory
    </b>
    legislation is that civil liability already incurred may not be changed by statute unless specifically so provided by the general assembly. Noe v. Dolan, 197<cite class="co_code">Colo. 32</cite>, 589 P.2d 483 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil liability already incurred may not be modified unless specifically provided by the general assembly. Hedstrom v. Motor Vehicle Div., 662 P.2d 173 (Colo. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Therefore, the repeal of a statute does not invalidate the accrued results of its operative tenure
    </b>
    and it will not be thus retroactively construed as undoing accrued results if not already required by language of the repealing act. State v. McMillin, 150<cite class="co_code">Colo. 23</cite>, 370 P.2d 435 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent an express legislative provision, the repeal of a statute will not operate retroactively to modify vested rights or liabilities. Stark v. Zimmerman, 638 P.2d 843 (Colo. App. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     And so long as there is a general law limiting the effect of the repeal,
    </b>
    it is declarative of the general policy of the state and takes effect unless the repealing act, or expiration clause, expressly provides otherwise. State v. McMillin, 150<cite class="co_code">Colo. 23</cite>, 370 P.2d 435 (1962); Wall v. Crawford, 103<cite class="co_code">Colo. 66</cite>, 82 P.2d 749 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Repealed statutory provisions remain in force
    </b>
    insofar as pending actions, suits, proceedings, and prosecutions are concerned. Martinez v. People, 174<cite class="co_code">Colo. 365</cite>, 484 P.2d 792 (1971); City of Westminster v. Hyland Hills Metro. Park &amp; Recreation Dist., 190<cite class="co_code">Colo. 558</cite>, 550 P.2d 337 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     To hold otherwise would do violence to the expressed and plain intent of the general assembly
    </b>
    that the reservation as to pending prosecutions applies equally to matters arising before repeal, even though prosecution not be had until after such repeal. Martinez v. People, 174<cite class="co_code">Colo. 365</cite>, 484 P.2d 792 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     And the provision for retention of penalties does not attempt to interfere in any manner with future legislation.
    </b>
    Wilson v. People, 36<cite class="co_code">Colo. 418</cite>, 85 P. 187 (1906); Cavanaugh v. Patterson, 41<cite class="co_code">Colo. 158</cite>, 91 P. 1117 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     But the repeal of a statute prescribing a penalty
    </b>
    shall not prevent a recovery of such penalty unless the repealing statute so provides. Cavanaugh v. Patterson, 41<cite class="co_code">Colo. 158</cite>, 91 P. 1117 (1907); Wilson v. People, 36<cite class="co_code">Colo. 418</cite>, 85 P. 187 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Its purpose then is to save the right to penalties incurred
    </b>
    when the repealing statute was silent on that question. Wilson v. People, 36<cite class="co_code">Colo. 418</cite>, 85 P. 187 (1906); Cavanaugh v. Patterson, 41<cite class="co_code">Colo. 158</cite>, 91 P. 1117 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     And hence, by virtue of its provisions, the repeal of a statute imposing penalties under certain conditions,
    </b>
    without any saving clause, does not prevent the recovery of such penalties when it appears that the repeal and subsequent statute are not inconsistent with its purpose. Wilson v. People, 36<cite class="co_code">Colo. 418</cite>, 85 P. 187 (1906); Cavanaugh v. Patterson, 41<cite class="co_code">Colo. 158</cite>, 91 P. 1117 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     And the provision for retention of penalties abrogates the rule that rights under statute repealed by subsequent law without saving clause are lost.
    </b>
    Cavanaugh v. Patterson, 41<cite class="co_code">Colo. 158</cite>, 91 P. 1117 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     However, the general saving character is limited to those acts which relate to a penalty, forfeiture or liability,
    </b>
    either civil or criminal, incurred under such acts. Peery v. City of Denver, 27<cite class="co_code">Colo. 93</cite>, 59 P. 747 (1899); Vail v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, 108<cite class="co_code">Colo. 206</cite>, 115 P.2d 389 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     The penalty, forfeiture or liability which is saved, is one not merely incurred
    </b>
    according to the terms of the repealed statute, but must be one incurred prior to the time the repealing act takes effect. Cobb v. Int'l State Bank, 67<cite class="co_code">Colo. 488</cite>, 186 P. 529 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     But the retention of penalties provision does not apply where a statute gives certain rights of action upon grounds of public policy,
    </b>
    no vested rights as to the continuance thereof are conferred, and notwithstanding the existence of a general saving statute such as this section, the repeal of the provision takes away all its benefits as regards incomplete actions existing at the time of the repeal, whether they be pending in appellate or trial courts. Vail v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, 108<cite class="co_code">Colo. 206</cite>, 115 P.2d 389 (1941).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
     The court has a right to assume that the general assembly, in passing a repealing statute without a savings clause,
    </b>
    had in view the terms, scope, and legal effect of this section evidently passed to provide for such contingencies. Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24<cite class="co_code">Colo. 418</cite>, 51 P. 165 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     The retention of penalties provision is in general terms
    </b>
    and it aims at no specific statute. Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24<cite class="co_code">Colo. 418</cite>, 51 P. 165 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     And is intended to embrace all statutes, both civil and criminal.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Since the retention of penalties provision is broad in its scope, ample in its terms,
    </b>
    therefore without giving undue force to its language, and without the adoption of a strained construction, it may be taken to be a part and parcel of a repealing or amending statute. Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24<cite class="co_code">Colo. 418</cite>, 51 P. 165 (1897).

       <p>
        <b>
     And if this is so, then a statute is amended and reenacted with this provision attached,

    and the court must read that section being repealed or amended as though it contained a provision that it should not be taken to extend to or affect any suits or proceedings already begun. Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24<cite class="co_code">Colo. 418</cite>, 51 P. 165 (1897).

     This section authorizes the revisor

    to correct obvious errors and inconsistencies in the laws in order to preserve the intent, effect, and meaning of each statutory provision, but it precludes him from making any change in the substance of a statute. Olin v. City of Ouray, 744 P.2d 761 (Colo. App. 1987), rev'd on other grounds, 761 P.2d 784 (Colo. 1988).

      <p>
       Where we conclude that the phrase "in the board's discretion" was intended to mean a board of county commissioners and that the legislature intended the statute to apply exclusively to county employees, the revisor's action was entirely proper and consistent with the revisor's statutory mandate to make such change in terminology as will improve the style and clarity of the laws, yet preserve the intent, effect, and meaning of each statutory provision.
