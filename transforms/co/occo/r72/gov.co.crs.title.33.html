      This article was numbered as article 1 of chapter 62, C.R.S. 1963. The substantive provisions of this article were repealed and reenacted in 1984 with an effective date of January 1, 1985, resulting in the addition, relocation, and elimination of sections as well as subject matter. For amendments to this article prior to 1984, consult the Colorado statutory research explanatory note and table itemizing the replacement volumes and supplements to the original volume of C.R.S. 1973 beginning on page vii in the front of this volume.

       The director may designate sole proprietors, partnerships, or corporations as license agents to sell hunting, fishing, trapping, and other licenses of the division. License agents shall be paid a commission, in an amount to be determined by rule by the commission, on all moneys collected for licenses sold. All agents authorized to sell licenses shall keep accurate records of all sales of licenses and shall make such reports to the division regarding license sales as may be required by the division. Such agents shall be required to give evidence of financial responsibility, in the form of a savings account, deposit, or certificate of deposit meeting the requirements of section  11-35-101, C.R.S., or an irrevocable letter of credit meeting the requirements of section  .5, C.R.S., or a bond, in such amount as may be fixed by the division based upon performance criteria established by the wildlife commission by rule, which may be less than the full value of consignment in an amount adequate to ensure the remittance of all moneys collected from such license sales, less amounts allowed as commissions, and the making of reports required by the division. The commission may promulgate rules for the establishment and cancellation of license agencies. All license moneys received shall be kept separate and apart from any other moneys of the agent authorized to sell licenses and shall at all times belong to the state. All moneys due from the sale of wildlife licenses shall belong to the state and shall draw interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from the date due.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol12">
       The executive director, state auditor, and attorney general, or their duly designated representatives, shall constitute a board of claims for the hearing of all claims for relief when any license agent is unable to account for licenses and claims that the same have been destroyed, lost, or stolen. The findings of the board of claims are subject to review pursuant to section  24-4-106, C.R.S. Claims for relief in an amount totaling three hundred dollars or less shall not be determined by the board of claims, except as otherwise provided in this section, but shall be settled by the division. If the division offers to make settlement and such settlement is not accepted by the claimant, the claimant may submit his claim to the board of claims.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol13">
       Every agent designated to sell licenses shall account for all licenses delivered to such agent. If any license agent is not able to account for any license, such agent shall be responsible for the maximum fee for which each unaccounted-for license could have been issued, except as provided in subsections (4) to (8) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol14">
       Any agent designated to sell licenses may make a claim under oath for relief from responsibility for licenses which have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and for which such agent is unable to account, but no claim for relief shall be considered unless the agent making the claim informs the division of such loss, theft, or destruction within thirty days after such loss, theft, or destruction is discovered, said notice to set forth in detail all pertinent information then known to the agent. Upon receipt of any claim for relief, it is the duty of the division to make an investigation of the claim as soon as practicable, and for that purpose the claimant shall make available such records, information, or other pertinent data as may be in his possession or under his control. A written report of such investigation shall be filed by the division with the board of claims.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol15">
       As soon as practicable after receipt of the investigator's report and in no event later than one hundred twenty days after receipt of notice of a claim for relief, the board of claims shall set a date for the hearing on such claim for relief, and the claimant may appear at the hearing if he so desires. The claimant shall be given not less than ten days' written notice of the date of the hearing, such notice to be mailed to his last-known address.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16">
       The board of claims may give relief to any claimant in the following circumstances and subject to the following limitations:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16a">
         If the board of claims is satisfied that any licenses were destroyed due to fire, flood, act of God, or any other cause beyond the control of the claimant and that destruction was not due in part to his negligence, then the board of claims may entirely relieve the claimant of the responsibility to account for such licenses or make such lesser adjustment as the board of claims may deem proper.
        </li>
        <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16b">
         If the board of claims is satisfied that any licenses were either lost, stolen, or destroyed under circumstances other than those set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection (6), the board of claims may, in its discretion, make an adjustment of the amount due for any such licenses. The board of claims, in determining what adjustment, if any, shall be allowed for any lost, stolen, or destroyed licenses, may consider the following:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16bI">
           Whether or not, or the extent to which, the loss was due to the negligence or carelessness of the claimant in the handling of licenses, but no adjustment shall be made in the case of gross negligence or gross carelessness upon his part;
          </li>
          <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16bII">
           Such other evidence as the board of claims may consider pertinent.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol17">
       The board of claims, in the event that it makes any adjustment upon a claim, may, in its discretion, require the use of such protection against the possibility of future loss, theft, or destruction of licenses as it may deem proper, including, but not limited to, the posting of corporate or personal surety bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol18">
       It is the legislative intent of subsections (2) to (7) of this section to provide in proper cases for the relief of license agents where licenses have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, which relief, however, shall be strictly construed, it being the further intent of such sections to encourage the proper and careful handling of licenses by license agents.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol19">
       The commission may promulgate rules and regulations for the cash sale of licenses, at a price which is discounted five percent from the face value thereof, to license agents of the division for resale to the public at the face value stated on such a license. Only the license agents of the division in good standing may qualify to purchase and sell under this subsection (9); except that no evidence of financial responsibility shall be required to qualify under this subsection (9). A post or base exchange of the United States government located in Colorado may qualify as a license agent for the purpose of this subsection (9). Failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission and lawful directives of the division regarding license agents shall be grounds for the suspension or termination of the license agency, and, upon suspension or termination, all unsold licenses shall be returned immediately to the division for return of cash in the amount paid by the license agent for the licenses. The commission, in connection with a program which it may adopt under this subsection (9), shall provide for redemption by the division, at least annually, of any unsold licenses in the amount paid by the license agent for such unsold licenses. The provisions of subsections (1) to (8) of this section, except the provisions of subsection (1) regarding the designation of license agents, shall not apply to licenses sold under this subsection (9).
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol110">
       The commission may authorize certain employees to sell licenses for the face value thereof at the headquarters and regional offices of the division. Such employees are not entitled to five percent of the face value of the licenses and are not required to give evidence of financial responsibility. Such employees may make claims under oath for relief from responsibility for licenses or moneys which have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and for which the employees are unable to account in accordance with the provisions of subsections (4) to (8) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol111">
       Any license agent who fails, upon demand of the division, to account for licenses or who fails to pay over to the division or its authorized representative moneys received from the sales of licenses:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol111a">
         When the amount in question is less than two hundred dollars, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment;
        </li>
        <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol111b">
         When the amount in question is two hundred dollars or more, commits a class 6 felony and shall be punished as provided in section  18-1.3-401, C.R.S., which punishment shall include a fine in an amount set out in section   (1)(a)(III), C.R.S.

       It is the intent of the voters of Colorado in adopting this measure to prohibit the taking of black bears when female black bears are rearing their cubs. It is the further intent of the voters of Colorado to promote the concept of fair chase in the taking of black bears by eliminating the use of bait and dogs. In considering proposed changes to the restrictions on the taking of black bears which are established in this measure, the Colorado general assembly shall take notice of the fact that this measure was adopted by a vote of the people at the 1992 general election.

      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101.3ol12">
       During the period from March 1 through September 1 of any calendar year, it is unlawful for any person to take a black bear by any means including but not limited to firearm or bow and arrow.

       It is unlawful for any person to take a black bear with the use of bait, or with the use of one or more dogs, at any time during any calendar year. In the event that a dog or dogs accidentally chases a black bear while the owner or person in control of such dog or dogs is in legal pursuit of other game, such owner or person in control of the dog or dogs shall not be charged with the illegal taking of a black bear so long as the dog or dogs are called off as soon as the mistake is realized and the black bear is not injured or killed.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101.3ol14">
       The provisions of this section shall not apply to employees or agents of the division of parks and wildlife or to field agents of the United States department of agriculture when such employees or agents are acting in their official capacity, nor shall this section apply to any person who lawfully takes a black bear in defense of livestock, real property, a motor vehicle, or human life pursuant to section  33-3-106.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101.3ol15">
       For purposes of this section, "bait" means to place, expose, deposit, distribute, or scatter salt, minerals, grain, animal parts, or other food, so as to constitute a lure, attraction, or enticement for black bears on or over any area where hunters are attempting to take black bears.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101.3ol16">
       Any person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided in section  18-1.3-501, C.R.S. In addition, persons convicted pursuant to this section shall have their wildlife license privileges suspended for five years and persons convicted of a second or subsequent offense pursuant to this section shall have their wildlife license privileges suspended permanently.

         The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the wildlife resources of the state are in danger of decline from increasing population pressures and the loss of wildlife habitat. In order to encourage private landowners to provide habitat that increases wildlife populations for the benefit of all hunters, discourage the harboring of game animals on private lands during public hunting seasons, and relieve hunting pressure on public lands by increasing game hunting on private lands, the general assembly finds that it is necessary to provide an incentive-based system to landowners to provide habitat for wildlife through a hunting license allocation program that allows hunters access to the state's wildlife under the cooperative control of the private landowner.

       A person of ordinary intelligence would know that if his or her criminal conviction has a close and logical connection to the person's hunting, trapping, or fishing activity, such conduct falls within the ambit of potential license suspension under this section.

        The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment of the United States constitution is not violated when a license suspension under this section is based on the same facts as the criminal charges.
       </b>
       License suspension under this section is a civil, not criminal, sanction. Furthermore, the primary goal of the general assembly in providing such civil sanction was not the imposition of punishment on the licensee, but the remedial purpose of protecting the public's interest in the state's wildlife.

        This section does not create a strict liability offense.
       </b>
       The culpable mental state of "knowingly" is implied for there to be a violation of this section. To be liable for "taking" wildlife, one must know that one is taking possession of wildlife. Even for a strict liability offense, the state must prove that the defendant committed a voluntary act. Therefore, when a major rainstorm caused a wastewater containment pond to overflow and kill fish in a river, the owner of the pond has not knowingly taken the fish, nor has the owner even committed a voluntary act or omission. Because the state did not allege or prove any knowing, voluntary act, the grant of summary judgment to the state was in error and the denial of the defendant's motion for summary judgment was also in error.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <b>
        The intent element for the crime of killing and abandoning wildlife is that of knowingly.
       </b>
       In order to be guilty of killing and abandoning wildlife, the defendant must "knowingly" kill and abandon wildlife. People v. Lawrence, 55 P.3d 155 (Colo. App. 2001) (decided prior to 2008 amendment to subsection (1)).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The mental state "knowingly"
       </b>
       is implied by "to take and abandon wildlife" because the language of the abandonment offense logically requires knowing that one abandoned wildlife. Nothing in that language is tied to specific intent, recklessness, or neglect. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007) (decided prior to 2008 amendment to subsection (1)).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        With the words, "to hunt or take...wildlife and detach or remove,
       </b>
       with the intent to abandon the carcass or body, only the head, hide, claws, teeth, antlers, horns, internal organs, or feathers, or any or all of such parts", the general assembly made it an offense to hunt or kill an animal with the intent to keep only certain parts and to abandon the rest of the carcass. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        "Abandon" is used here in its ordinary sense.
       </b>
       No special, legal meaning is ascribed to the term, and it was not necessary that defendant break camp or leave the state to be found to have abandoned elk carcasses. People v. Dobson, 847 P.2d 176 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The phrase "to abandon the carcass or body of such wildlife; or to take and abandon wildlife"
       </b>
       is to be read to stand on its own. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Willful destruction of wildlife
       </b>
       requires proof that a person removed the trophy portions of any wild animal and abandoned the carcass. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The general assembly

       <li id="t33-parks-ar10-s33-10-107ol11">
        The commission has power to:
        <ol Class="alpha">
         <li id="t33-parks-ar10-s33-10-107ol11a">
          Acquire by gift, transfer, lease, purchase, or long-term operating agreement such land and water, or interests in land and water, as the director, with the approval of the executive director, deems necessary, suitable, or proper for parks and outdoor recreation purposes or for the preservation or conservation of sites, scenes, open space, and vistas of public interest. As used in this section, "interest in land and water" means any and all rights and interest in land less than the full fee interest, including future interests, easements, covenants, and contractual rights. Every interest in land and water held by the commission when properly recorded runs with the land or water to which it pertains for the benefit of the citizens of this state and may be protected and enforced by the commission in the district court of the county in which the land or water, or any portion thereof, is located.

All sales of property, water rights, or lands shall be at public sale, and the commission has the right to reject any or all bids. As used in this paragraph (b), "exchange" means the transferring of property, water rights, land, or interest in land or water rights to another person in consideration for the transfer to the commission of other property, water rights, land, or interest in land or water rights, or cash, or any combination thereof; except that any cash received may not exceed fifty percent of the total value of the consideration. A transaction otherwise qualifying as an exchange is not deemed a sale merely because dollar values have been assigned to any property, water rights, land, or interest in land or water rights, for the purpose of ensuring that the commission will receive adequate compensation.

The capital development committee shall review the reports submitted by the commission and make recommendations to the commission concerning the proposed land transaction within thirty days from the day on which the report is received. The commission shall not complete the transaction without considering the recommendations of the capital development committee, if the recommendations are made in a timely manner.

       In order to provide for the greatly increasing outdoor needs of a rapidly expanding Colorado population for public access to, travel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the out-of-doors areas of Colorado and for the conservation, development, and use of natural resources against fire and other natural and geological hazards, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of this state and among the purposes of this article to: Increase the accessibility and encourage the use of such natural resources by the residents of this state and by nonresidents; provide opportunity for the development of public and private facilities for persons visiting and utilizing the natural resources of this state; encourage an increase in riding, hiking, bicycling, and other compatible recreational activities as influences for the improvement of the health and welfare of the people; and to provide for the needs of specialized recreational motor vehicles. It is recognized that joint simultaneous trail use by motorized and nonmotorized interests may at times be incompatible, and it is the intent of this article to provide separate trails and facilities for each of such motorized and nonmotorized interests, when feasible.

      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-102ol12">
       To implement the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and as additional purposes of this article, the state may: Establish and maintain trails on a statewide basis to connect, when feasible and practical, the units of the parks and outdoor recreation system, federal recreational lands, and other trails systems; perpetuate and provide the use of and access to regions and trails of special or historic interest within the state; assist local governments in serving the requirements of the urban and other population centers of the state; encourage the multiple use of public rights-of-way and utilize to the fullest extent the existing and future scenic roads, highways, parkways, and federally administered trails where feasible as recreational trails; encourage the development and maintenance of recreational trails by counties, cities, and special improvement districts and assist in such development and maintenance by all means available; coordinate trail plans and development among legal jurisdictions and with the state and federal governments; encourage, when possible, the development of trails on federal lands by the federal government; and promote at all levels of government a more complete use of all or any portion of public property for recreational purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-102ol13">
       A further purpose of this article is to promote the establishment and operation of a statewide network of trails, to be known as the "Colorado greenway trails system", along and between the state's lakes, streams, or reservoirs linking cities, towns, communities, and river basins. The Colorado greenway trails system shall be established and operated in a manner that promotes recreational opportunities along lakes, streams, or reservoirs, that provides access to and is a part of an integrated trail system, that protects water rights and real property rights, and that minimizes conflicts between recreationists and others to minimize adverse impacts on natural features and sensitive habitats.

       In order to provide recreational trails in a statewide system of positive recreational value, the division may acquire reasonable trail rights-of-way or easements. In selecting the rights-of-way, full consideration shall be given to minimizing the adverse effects upon the adjacent landowner or user and his operation. Development and management of each segment of the trails system shall be designed to harmonize with and complement any established multiple-use plans for that specific area in order to insure continued maximum benefits from the land. Acquisition shall be, whenever possible, through donations, purchased with donated funds, or through easements and exchanges. When such methods fail, the division may authorize expenditure of state appropriations for acquisition in fee. Agreements for less than fee shall be for terms of not less than twenty-five years whenever possible.

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the system of state parks and state recreation areas is vital to the economic health and well-being of the entire state of Colorado and that such system of parks and recreation areas provides an important benefit to the citizens of this state and to the tourists from outside the state who visit and make use of such state parks and recreation areas. Because of the nature and operation of such state parks and recreation areas, the system can be largely self-supporting, and the users of such resources can help to fund the system's operation and maintenance. The general assembly declares and intends that as a matter of state policy the system of state parks and state recreation areas should be financed as much as reasonably possible through revenues derived from the users of such system.

The commission, in connection with a program that it may adopt under this subsection (9), shall provide for redemption by the division, at least annually, of any unsold passes and registrations in the amount paid by the agent for such unsold passes and registrations.

       The owner of each vessel requiring numbering by this state shall file an application for a number with the division or any representative approved by the division on forms approved and furnished by the division. The owner of the vessel must sign the application and pay an application fee as specified by the commission by rule; except that those vessels owned and operated by the state or any political subdivision of the state must be registered without payment of a registration fee. Upon receipt of the application in approved form, the division or its representative shall issue to the applicant a registration stating the number issued to the vessel. The number issued shall be painted on or attached to each side of the bow on the forward half of the vessel or, if there are no such sides, at a corresponding location on both sides of the foredeck of the vessel for which it is issued. The number issued must read from left to right in block characters of good proportion having a minimum of three inches in height, excluding border or trim, and of a color that contrasts with the color of the background, and must remain clearly visible and legible. Other numbers must not be carried on the bow of the vessel. Any person who fails to display a vessel number as required in this subsection (1) is guilty of a class 2 petty offense and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of twenty-five dollars.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar13-s33-13-104ol12">
       The registration shall be of pocket size and shall be on board and available at all times for inspection whenever the vessel for which it is issued is in operation in this state. Any person who violates this subsection (2) is guilty of a class 2 petty offense and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of fifty dollars. If a registration is lost or destroyed, the owner shall, within fifteen days, notify the division. The notification shall be in writing, shall describe the circumstances of the loss or destruction, and shall be accompanied by a fee for a replacement registration as required under section  33-12-101.

      <li id="t33-parks-ar13-s33-13-104ol13">
       When a numbered vessel is lost, destroyed, or abandoned, the registration issued for the vessel shall be surrendered to the division within fifteen days after any such event. When the owner of a numbered vessel changes his or her address from that shown on the registration, the owner shall notify the division within fifteen days of such change and, as a part of such notification, shall furnish the division with his or her new address. The commission may provide in its rules for the surrender of the registration bearing the former address and its replacement with a registration bearing the correct address or for the alteration of an outstanding registration to show the new address of the owner.

       33-32-101. Legislative declaration.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly declares that it is the policy of this state to promote and encourage residents and nonresidents alike to participate in the enjoyment and use of the rivers of this state and, to that end, in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of safeguarding the health, safety, welfare, and freedom from injury or danger of such residents and nonresidents, to license and regulate those persons who provide river-running services in the nature of equipment or personal services to such residents and nonresidents for the purpose of floating on rivers in this state unless the provider of such river-running services is providing such river-running services exclusively for family or friends. It is not the intent of the general assembly to interfere in any way with private land owner rights along rivers or to prevent the owners of whitewater equipment from using said equipment to accommodate friends when no consideration is involved; nor is it the intent of the general assembly to interfere in any way with the general public's ability to enjoy the recreational value of state rivers when the services of river outfitters are not utilized or to interfere with the right of the United States to manage public lands and waters under its control. The general assembly recognizes that river outfitters, as an established business on rivers flowing within and without this state, make a significant contribution to the economy of this state and that the number of residents and nonresidents who are participating in river-running is steadily increasing.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that certain lands and waters of this state representing diverse ecosystems, ecological communities, and other natural features or phenomena, which are our natural heritage, are increasingly threatened with irreversible change and are in need of special identification and protection and that it is in the public interest of present and future generations to preserve, protect, perpetuate, and enhance specific examples of these natural features and phenomena as an enduring resource. It is the intent of this article to provide a means by which these natural features and phenomena can be identified, evaluated, and protected through a statewide system of designated natural areas.

        Landowners are entitled to protection by knowingly permitting recreational use of their property.
       </b>
       A subjective intent requirement is not required. Instead, it is enough that a landowner's purposeful actions implicitly allowed or acquiesced in the use of the land. Nelson v. United States, 827 F.3d 927 (10th Cir. 2016).

        "[K]nowingly" refers to
       </b>
       one's awareness of objective facts, while "willfully" pertains to one's subjective intent to act on--or in spite of--that awareness. Nelson v. United States, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        To be "willful", an action must be taken voluntarily, purposefully, and with a conscious disregard for the consequences of the act.
       </b>
       It is more than negligence. Willfulness does not, however, require that a government employee be consciously aware that his or her acts or omissions create danger or risk to the safety of others, or that the employee intended to harm another. Nelson v. United States, 256 F. Supp. 3d 1136 (D.

      <p>
       <b>
        The knowledge element of the liability exception
       </b>
       in subsection (1)(a) is not qualified by "reason to know" and thus requires actual knowledge. Further, that knowledge element applies to both the existence of the dangerous condition and the likelihood that it will cause harm. Nelson v. United States, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Accordingly, a landowner may be liable only if its agent actually knew of the existence of a sinkhole that caused a user's injuries and that the sinkhole was likely to cause harm. Nelson v. United States, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>

        A "dangerous condition" is a physical condition of a facility or the use of a facility that constitutes an unreasonable risk to the health or safety of the public.

        A sinkhole/washout was a dangerous condition likely to cause harm to users of a bike path.

       A sinkhole has a high probability of causing harm to a person riding a bicycle on a recreational path the landowner knows is used by cyclists if the sinkhole is of significant size and depth, covers the entire width of the path, and is hard to see.

        Landowner's agent's knowledge of a sinkhole/washout is imputed to the landowner

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that it is in the interest of the state of Colorado to establish reasonable safety standards for the operation of ski areas and for the skiers using them. Realizing the dangers that inhere in the sport of skiing, regardless of any and all reasonable safety measures that can be employed, the purpose of this article 44 is to supplement the passenger tramway safety provisions of article 150 of title 12; to further define the legal responsibilities of ski area operators and their agents and employees; to define the responsibilities of skiers using such ski areas; and to define the rights and liabilities existing between the skier and the ski area operator and between skiers.

       is to establish reasonable safety standards and to define relative rights and responsibilities of ski area operators and skiers. Graven v. Vail Assocs., Inc., 909 P.2d 514 (Colo. 1995).

       to use the highest degree of care commensurate with the practical operation of the lift, regardless of the season. The general assembly did not intend for the regulations adopted by the tramway board to preclude common law negligence actions against ski lift operators or the duty to exercise the highest degree of care.

       an area presenting variations in steepness or terrain, such as a drop-off or ravine is an area presenting inherent dangers and risks of skiing and is not a "danger area" requiring a particular type of warning sign. Graven v. Vail Assocs., Inc. 888 P.2d 310 (Colo. App. 1994).

       "Ski slopes or trails" includes all ski slopes or trails and adjoining skiable terrain; therefore, ski area operators do not simply have a duty to mark ski area boundaries in a fashion readily visible to skiers who are located in certain designated areas, but instead they are required to mark boundaries in a fashion readily visible to any person skiing on a slope, trail, or adjoining skiable terrain.
