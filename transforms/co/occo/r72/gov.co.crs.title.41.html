       Any combination, or any county in this state acting independently, may create an authority that is authorized to operate an airport in this state and exercise the functions conferred by the provisions of this article, upon the issuance by the director of the division of local government in the department of local affairs of a certificate reciting that the authority has been duly organized according to the laws of the state of Colorado. Such certificate shall be issued by the director of said division upon the filing with him or her of a certified copy of the resolution of the county acting independently and, in the case of a combination, of each county or municipality joining therein, duly certified as correct by the clerk of the municipality or county. In the case of a combination, there shall also be filed with the director of said division a joint certificate of the clerks of any county or municipality joining therein, certifying that such counties or municipalities, and listing them, constitute all of the counties or municipalities joining in the formation of the authority. At the time of filing such resolutions, there shall also be filed a designation of the official name of the authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t41-generally-ar03-s41-3-104ol12">
       Any combination creating an authority may be increased from time to time to include one or more additional counties or municipalities, if each additional municipality or county and the members then included in the authority and the board of commissioners of the authority, respectively, adopt a resolution consenting thereto. Any authority which was created by a county acting independently may be increased from time to time to include one or more additional counties or municipalities, if each additional municipality or county and the county creating the authority and the board of commissioners of the authority, respectively, adopt a resolution consenting thereto. Upon the inclusion of any county or municipality in an authority initially created by a county acting independently, such authority shall be deemed to have been created by a combination for purposes of this article. Upon the inclusion of any county or municipality in the authority so created, either initially or as an additional member later, all rights, contracts, obligations, and property, both real and personal, of such municipality or county used for or in relation to transportation by air shall vest in the authority created pursuant to this section, unless otherwise specifically provided by the resolution including such municipality or county in the authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t41-generally-ar03-s41-3-104ol13">
       Any combination formed to create an authority may be decreased if each of the members then included therein and the board of the authority consent to the decrease and make provision for the retention or disposition of the assets and liabilities of the county or municipality, as the case may be; but, if the authority has any bonds outstanding, no such decrease shall be effective until at least seventy-five percent of the holders of the outstanding bonds of the authority consent thereto in writing, or unless the board determines that such decrease will not affect adversely the rights of the holders of such outstanding bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t41-generally-ar03-s41-3-104ol14">
       A municipality or a county in this state shall not adopt a resolution authorized by this section without a public hearing thereon. Notice shall be given at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality or county, as the case may be.
      </li>
      <li id="t41-generally-ar03-s41-3-104ol15">
       All commissioners of an authority shall be appointed for a term of four years each; except that a vacancy occurring other than by the expiration of term shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the original appointments.

      <li id="t41-generally-ar03-s41-3-104ol16">
       Any authority created pursuant to the provisions of this article shall cease to exist upon the filing with the director of the division of local government of a certified resolution of each county or municipality composing the authority requesting the termination of such authority; but adequate provisions shall be made for the payment of the outstanding bonds of the authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t41-generally-ar03-s41-3-104ol17">
       Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, the general assembly may, by law, authorize the governor, on behalf of the state, to join in the creation of any airport authority authorized by this article or to join any existing airport authority created pursuant to this article.

       All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon any authority organized pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be exercised and performed by and through the board except as otherwise provided by law; but the exercise of any and all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers may be by said board delegated and redelegated to any of the officers created or by the board acting under this article.
      </li>
      <li id="t41-generally-ar03-s41-3-105ol12">
       The board of commissioners of an authority created by the formation of a combination shall consist of at least five members, but no more than nine members, representing the counties or municipalities participating in the combination. The authorizing resolution, filed with the director of the division of local government in the department of local affairs, as provided in section  41-3-104 (1), shall contain a provision as to the representation of the counties and municipalities participating in the combination. The members of the board of an authority created by a combination shall be appointed by resolution of the governing boards of the counties or municipalities that are members of the combination, the initial appointments, at the election of such municipality or county, to be made by the authorizing resolution filed with the director of said division. If the county in which the airport is to be located is not a member of the combination, then the member or members, if any, to which such county is entitled shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners of such county. The board created by the independent action of a county shall consist of five members who shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners of the county, and initial appointments to such board, at the election of the board of county commissioners, may be made in the authorizing resolution filed with the director of said division. Board members from municipalities and counties in this state shall be taxpaying electors, as defined in section  1-1-104 (49), C.R.S., at the time of their appointment, residing in the municipality or county from which appointed. After an authority is organized by the formation of a combination, the inclusion of additional counties or municipalities shall entitle the included municipalities or counties to representation on the same basis as other counties or municipalities. Each member of the board may receive as compensation for his or her services a sum not in excess of sixty dollars per year. No member of the board shall receive any compensation as an employee of the authority or otherwise, other than that provided in this section, and no member of the board shall be interested in any contract or transaction with the authority except in his or her official respective capacity.

At the first meeting of the board of a newly formed authority the commissioners shall determine by lot which members shall serve for two-year terms and which shall serve for four-year terms. At the expiration of the term of any commissioner, a new appointment shall be made by the appropriate governing board, and any member may be appointed to succeed himself.

       A change of residence of a member of the board from a municipality or county in the state to a place outside the municipality that he or she represents, or the county from which he or she is appointed, automatically creates a vacancy on the board as to such municipality or county. Vacancies which may occur on the board through death or resignation of one of the members, or for any other reason, shall be filled in the same manner as provided for the appointment of original members of the board.

Such notices shall remain posted and shall be changed in the event that the time or place of such regular meeting is changed. Special meetings may be called by any officer or member of the board by informing the other members of the date, time, and place of such meeting and the purpose for which it is called, and by posting as provided in this paragraph (a) at least three days previous to said meeting. All business of the board shall be conducted only during such regular or special meetings, and all of such meetings shall be open to the public.

         To borrow money and to issue bonds payable in whole or in part from the income of the authority and otherwise secured to the extent permitted by law; but, before any money shall be borrowed or any bonds issued, such borrowing or sale shall first be approved by the board of county commissioners of any county independently creating an authority under the provisions of this article. Said bonds shall be authorized by resolution of said board without the necessity of submitting the question of their issuance to the qualified electors of the municipalities or counties constituting members of the authority. Said resolution shall prescribe the form of said bonds, the manner of their execution, which may be effected by the use of the facsimile signatures of the officers of the authority in accordance with the laws of the state in effect at the time of their execution, shall provide for the terms thereof, including the maximum net effective interest rate for the issue of bonds, and the security for their payment, may authorize the issuance of additional bonds having a lien on a parity with or junior thereto on the income of the authority, provide for the redemption of said bonds prior to their respective maturities with or without premium, and direct that said bonds shall be sold at public or private sale at or below par, but such bonds shall not be sold at a price such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds exceeds the maximum net effective interest rate authorized. The board shall prescribe other details in connection with the issue of bonds. The bonds so authorized shall mature serially over a period not exceeding thirty years and shall bear interest at a net effective interest rate not exceeding the maximum net effective interest rate authorized. Said resolution and bonds may also include such other terms or recitals which in the judgment of the board are necessary or proper to render the same marketable. Nothing in this article shall be construed as authorizing the authority or any county to assess and levy taxes for the payment of said bonds, nor shall said bonds be construed to be an indebtedness of the municipalities or counties constituting members of the authority or of the county independently creating such authority within the meaning of any constitutional, charter, or statutory limitation.

        Imposition of user fee by airport authority upon rental car company
       </b>
       which is based upon portion of gross revenues of company attributable to customers picked up at airport does not constitute an illegal income tax. Westrac, Inc. v. Walker Field, 812 P.2d 714 (Colo. App. 1991).

       <b>
        Distinction between fee and tax based upon nature and function of the charge
       </b>
       rather than by its label. Fees charged for use of public facility owned by municipal corporation are not taxes if purpose is to defray expenses for operating and improving facility and if fees are only imposed on users of facility. Taxes are not based on amount of use and the proceeds thereof are used to defray general municipal expenses. Westrac, Inc. v. Walker Field, 812 P.2d 714 (Colo. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Since this section does not impose requirement of reasonableness for imposition of fees by airport authorities,
       </b>
       such authorities have broad discretion regarding imposition of such fees which is subject only to constitutional and federal statutory limitations. Absent any express statutory limitations, judicial deference will be given to the sound discretion of airport authority imposing such fees. Westrac, Inc. v. Walker Field, 812 P.2d 714 (Colo. App. 1991).

        User fee imposed by airport authority upon rental car company
       </b>
       which is based upon portion of gross revenues of company attributable to customers picked up at airport is not arbitrary or confiscatory since the fee is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest in providing airport facilities and since the fee is not prohibitive of an entire industry. Westrac, Inc. v. Walker Field, 812 P.2d 714 (Colo. App. 1991).

        Operation of airport is governmental function.
       </b>
       A city, in voluntarily assuming a power and exercising a function for the benefit of the municipality and extending aid toward the promotion and accommodation of air commerce and travel, did so in its municipal or proprietary capacity as distinguished from a governmental function assigned to it to enforce the general policy of the state in the administration of general laws. However, if the operation of the municipal airport by the city is in keeping with the declared policy of the general assembly to be a governmental function, then the power of the city to act for the purpose of the promotion and convenience of travel by air is further amplified, instead of restricted, by this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       City elected to provide certain necessary services and supplies by leasing portions of the airport to a fixed base operator, which would in turn provide those supplies and services to the airport users. The operation of the airport with respect to such essential functions is not for the particular benefit of the citizens of the municipality, but, rather, for the public good in general. Under these circumstances, the city was operating in its governmental capacity. Cherry Creek Aviation v. City of Steamboat Springs, 958 P.2d 511 (Colo. App. 1998).

A county, city and county, city, or town may acquire, in the same manner as is provided for the acquisition of property for airport purposes, easements through or other interests in airspaces over land or water, interests in airport hazards outside the boundaries of the airports or landing fields, and such other airport protection privileges as are necessary to ensure safe approaches to the landing areas of said airports or landing fields and the safe and efficient operation thereof. It is also hereby authorized to acquire, in the same manner, the right or easement, for a term of years or perpetually, to place or maintain suitable marks for the daytime markings and suitable lights for the nighttime markings of airport hazards, and including the right of ingress and egress to or from such airport hazards, for the purpose of maintaining and repairing such lights and marks.

I, the undersigned spaceflight participant, assume the inherent risk of participating in this spaceflight activity.
