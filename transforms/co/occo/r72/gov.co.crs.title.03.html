     A transfer of exclusive jurisdiction rests upon a grant by the state, through consent or cession, and it follows in accordance with familiar principles applicable to grants,

     Therefore the mere fact that the United States needs and acquires property within a state's boundaries does not necessitate the assumption by the government

     In conformity with the rule that the government has power to accept exclusive jurisdiction or less, congress, in order to create a definite method of acceptance
    </b>
    of jurisdiction so that all persons could know whether, as to particular property, the government had obtained no jurisdiction at all, or partial jurisdiction, or exclusive jurisdiction, enacted a law providing that United States agencies and authorities may accept exclusive jurisdiction of lands acquired by the United States by filing a notice with the Governor of the state, and that unless and until that is done, it shall be conclusively presumed that no such jurisdiction has been accepted.

     The lack of federal responsibility within federal enclaves resulted in recognition at a relatively early time of the doctrine
